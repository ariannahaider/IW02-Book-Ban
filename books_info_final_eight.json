While his family and friends are accepting and supportive, the same can\u2019t be said about everyone in their small town of Barton Springs, Ohio.</p><p>When Jake\u2019s dad hangs a comically large pride flag in their front yard in an overblown show of love, the mayor begins to receive complaints. A few people are even concerned the flag will lead to something truly outlandish: a pride parade.</p><p>Except Jake doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a ridiculous idea. Why can\u2019t they hold a pride festival in Barton Springs? The problem is, Jake knows he\u2019ll have to get approval from the town council, and the mayor won\u2019t be on his side. And as Jake and his friends try to find a way to bring Pride to Barton Springs, it seems suspicious that the mayor\u2019s son, Brett, suddenly wants to spend time with Jake.</p><p>But someone that cute couldn\u2019t possibly be in league with his mayoral mother, could he?</p><ul><li>An ALA Rainbow List Pick</li><li>A 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards Finalist for Best Middle Grade and Children\u2019s Book</li><li>A School Library Journal Best Book of 2022</li><li>A Maine Student Book Award 2023-2024 Reading List Nominee</li></ul>",

But his plans are derailed when his pilot father is selected for a highly-publicized NASA mission to Mars. Within days, Cal and his parents leave Brooklyn for hot and humid Houston. <br> <br>With the entire nation desperate for any new information about the astronauts, Cal finds himself thrust in the middle of a media circus. Suddenly his life is more like a reality TV show, with his constantly bickering parents struggling with their roles as the &quot;perfect American family.&quot; <br><br>And then Cal meets Leon, whose mother is another astronaut on the mission, and he finds himself falling head over heels--and fast. They become an oasis for each other amid the craziness of this whole experience. As their relationship grows, so does the frenzy surrounding the Mars mission, and when secrets are revealed about ulterior motives of the program, Cal must find a way to get to the truth without hurting the people who have become most important to him.<br><br><b>An IndieBound YA Bestseller!</b><br><b>An IndieNext List Pick!</b><br><b>An Amazon Best Book!</b><br><b>A Goodreads Choice Award Finalist!</b><br><b>A <i>Cosmopolitan </i>Best Young Adult Book of the Year!</b><br><b>Recommended on the TODAY Show!</b>",

She's the real deal, an Elemental with the power to control fire, earth, water, and air. But even though she lives in Salem, Massachusetts, her magic is a secret she has to keep to herself. If she's ever caught using it in front of a Reg (non-witch), she could lose it. For good. So, Hannah spends most of her time avoiding her ex-girlfriend (and fellow Elemental Witch) Veronica, hanging out with her best friend, and working at the Fly by Night Cauldron selling candles and crystals to tourists, goths, and local Wiccans.<br><br>But when a terrifying blood ritual interrupts the end-of-school-year bonfire and evidence of dark magic begins to appear all over Salem, Hannah's sure it's the work of a deadly Blood Witch. However her coven seems less than convinced, forcing Hannah to team up with the last person she wants to see: Veronica. With everything she loves on the line, Hannah will have to test the limits of her power if she's going to save her coven.<br><br>\"Infused with page-turning suspense, bittersweet romance, shocking twists, and tragic turns, Sterling has written a standout debut.\" \u2014Dana Mele, author of People Like Us",

      "description": "From the New York Times best-selling author of Disney's Villains series comes a ghostly new stand-alone novel that reimagines The Legend of Sleepy Hollow through the eyes of a modern teen. The two-hundredth anniversary of the Headless Horseman's legendary haunting of Sleepy Hollow is approaching, but Kat van Tassel wants nothing to do with the town's superstitious celebrations. As a descendant of the original Katrina van Tassel, Kat knows she's expected to fulfill her ancestor's legacy by someday marrying her longtime boyfriend and running the prestigious family estate. But Kat dreams of a life outside Sleepy Hollow. Then Kat meets Isadora, a new girl in town who challenges Kat to reexamine those expectations, opens her eyes to the possibility that ghosts are real, and makes her question who she truly wants to be . . . and be with. When Kat is given the original Katrina's diary, a new legend begins to take shape, one that weaves together the past and the present in eerie ways. Can Kat uncover a two-hundred-year-old secret, and trace its shocking reverberations in her own life, in time to protect what she truly loves? Fans of Serena Valentino will delight in this supernatural coming-of-age tale that finally gives the women of Sleepy Hollow a chance to tell their side of the story.",

      "description": "<b>This stunning YA debut is a timely and heartfelt speculative narrative about healing, faith, and freedom.</b><br><br>Seventeen-year-old Marisol has always dreamed of being American, learning what Americans and the US are like from television and Mrs. Rosen, an elderly expat who had employed Marisol's mother as a maid. When she pictured an American life for herself, she dreamed of a life like Aimee and Amber's, the title characters of her favorite American TV show. She never pictured fleeing her home in El Salvador under threat of death and stealing across the US border as \"an illegal\", but after her brother is murdered and her younger sister, Gabi's, life is also placed in equal jeopardy, she has no choice, especially because she knows everything is her fault. If she had never fallen for the charms of a beautiful girl named Liliana, Pablo might still be alive, her mother wouldn't be in hiding and she and Gabi wouldn't have been caught crossing the border.<br> <br>But they have been caught and their asylum request will most certainly be denied. With truly no options remaining, Marisol jumps at an unusual opportunity to stay in the United States. She's asked to become a grief keeper, taking the grief of another into her own body to save a life. It's a risky, experimental study, but if it means Marisol can keep her sister safe, she will risk anything. She just never imagined one of the risks would be falling in love, a love that may even be powerful enough to finally help her face her own crushing grief.<br> <br>The Grief Keeper is a tender tale that explores the heartbreak and consequences of when both love and human beings are branded illegal.",

Through reframing their own coming-of-age story, Ziyad takes readers on a powerful journey of growing up queer and Black in Cleveland, Ohio, and of navigating the equally complex path toward finding their true self in New York City. Exploring childhood, gender, race, and the trust that is built, broken, and repaired through generations, Ziyad investigates what it means to live beyond the limited narratives Black children are given and challenges the irreconcilable binaries that restrict them.</p> <p>Heartwarming and heart-wrenching, radical and reflective, Hari Ziyad's vital memoir is for the outcast, the unheard, the unborn, and the dead. It offers us a new way to think about survival and the necessary disruption of social norms. It looks back in tenderness as well as justified rage, forces us to address where we are now, and, born out of hope, illuminates the possibilities for the future.</p>",

      "description": "<b>After she unwittingly frees a dangerous contract killer, a surgeon reluctantly joins forces with a tenacious detective obsessed with taking down their enemy at all costs.</b></br></br>As a surgeon, Dr. Rennie Newton is the consummate professional. When she's summoned to jury duty, she brings competence and composure to the courtroom -- a skill she learned while performing surgeries. It is this commitment to precision that compels her to deliver a not guilty verdict in the murder case against notorious contract killer Ricky Lozada.</br></br> It will be the most regrettable decision of her life. When a rival colleague is brutally slain, Lozada's menacing shadow looms over the murder, but the investigators pinpoint Rennie as the prime suspect. Soon, the police begin violating the privacy she has cultivated and protected at all costs. And when Lozada begins an earnest courtship, it becomes terrifyingly clear that he is obsessed with having her.</br></br> Wick Threadgill is a detective on indefinite leave from the Fort Worth PD with a very personal agenda for the contract killer. Temperamental, bitter, and driven by loyalty and love, Wick is determined to destroy Lozada. In order to defeat him -- and save their own lives -- Rennie and Wick form an uneasy alliance.</br></br> Mistrustful of each other, they know only one thing with absolute certainty: like one of Lozada's prize scorpions, they won't see it coming when this killer strikes. <i>The Crush</i> will take you on a tortuous path through a twisted sociopath's eerie obsession, a haunted man's fragile hopes for redemption, and a woman's heart as she struggles to face her greatest fear: to open herself to love.</br></br><b></b>",

      "description": "Three women who share one fate: The Boleyn Inheritance: Anne of Cleves: She runs from her tiny country, her hateful mother, and her abusive brother to a throne whose last three occupants are dead. King Henry VIII, her new husband, instantly dislikes her. Without friends, family, or even an understanding of the language being spoken around her, she must literally save her neck in a court ruled by a deadly game of politics and the terror of an unpredictable and vengeful king. Her Boleyn Inheritance: accusations and false witnesses. Katherine Howard: She catches the king's eye within moments of arriving at court, setting in motion the dreadful machine of politics, intrigue, and treason that she does not understand. She only knows that she is beautiful, that men desire her, that she is young and in love -- but not with the diseased old man who made her queen, beds her night after night, and killed her cousin Anne. Her Boleyn Inheritance: the threat of the axe. Jane Rochford: She is the Boleyn girl whose testimony sent her husband and sister-in-law to their deaths. She is the trusted friend of two threatened queens, the perfectly loyal spy for her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and a canny survivor in the murderous court of a most dangerous king. Throughout Europe, her name is a byword for malice, jealousy, and twisted lust. Her Boleyn Inheritance: a fortune and a title, in exchange for her soul. The Boleyn Inheritance is a novel drawn tight as a lute string about a court ruled by the gallows and three women whose positions brought them wealth, admiration, and power as well as deceit, betrayal, and terror. Once again, Philippa Gregory has brought a vanished world to life -- the whisper of a silk skirt on a stone stair, the yellow glow of candlelight illuminating a hastily written note, the murmurs of the crowd gathering on Tower Green below the newly built scaffold. In The Boleyn Inheritance Gregory is at her intelligent and page-turning best.",

When they meet and are married, the match becomes as passionate as it is politically expedient. The young lovers revel in each other\u2019s company and plan the England they will make together. But tragically, aged only fifteen, Arthur falls ill and extracts from his sixteen-year-old bride a deathbed promise to marry his brother, Henry; become Queen; and fulfill their dreams and her destiny.<br> <br> Widowed and alone in the avaricious world of the Tudor court, Katherine has to sidestep her father-in-law\u2019s desire for her and convince him, and an incredulous Europe, that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated, that there is no obstacle to marriage with Henry. For seven years, she endures the treachery of spies, the humiliation of poverty, and intense loneliness and despair while she waits for the inevitable moment when she will step into the role she has prepared for all her life. Then, like her warrior mother, Katherine must take to the battlefield and save England when its old enemies the Scots come over the border and there is no one to stand against them but the new Queen.",

She is Amy Dudley, wife of Sir Robert, and she knows that Elizabeth\u2019s ambitious leap to the throne will draw her husband back to the center of the glamorous Tudor court, where he was born to be.<br> <br> Elizabeth\u2019s excited triumph is short-lived. She has inherited a bankrupt country where treason is rampant and foreign war a certainty. Her faithful advisors warns her that she will survive only if she marries a strong prince to govern the rebellious country, but the one man Elizabeth desires is her childhood friend, the ambitious Robert Dudley. As the young couple falls back in love, a question hangs in the air: can he really set aside his wife and marry the queen? When Amy is found dead, Elizabeth and Dudley are suddenly plunged into a struggle for survival.",

As a teen, she struggled to realize and accept her own identity. Her frank, sensitive book is written for teens who are beginning to question their sexual or gender identity, those who interested in GLBT issues and rights, and those who need guidance, reassurance, or reminders that they aren't alone.<br> <br> Kelly offers practical advice, knowing encouragement, accessible resources, and real-life testimonials from teens who've \"been there.\" Topics include coming out (the pluses and minuses), facing prejudice and pressure, getting support, navigating relationships, staying safe, making healthy choices, surviving and thriving in high school, and more.<br> <br> The message throughout is strong and clear: By accepting yourself, you take charge of your own future.<br> <br> Created with feedback and suggestions from individuals at PFLAG (Parents, families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), GLSEN (the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network), GLAAD (the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), and other organizations, this book is for any GLBTQ teen--and any straight friend, parent, teacher, counselor, youth leader, or other adult who cares and wants to understand.<br>",

Something more than chance--and nothing less than destiny--has brought them together in a world whose hour of reckoning is fast approaching. <br>Praise for \"Innocence\" <br>\"A thriller that's both chilling and fulfilling.\"--\"People\" (four stars) <br>\"Laced with fantastical mysticism, it's an allegory of nonviolence, acceptance and love in the face of adversity. . . . The narrative is intense, with an old-fashioned ominousness and artistically crafted descriptions. . . . An optimistic and unexpected conclusion [mirrors] his theme. Something different this way comes from Mr. Koontz's imagination. Enjoy.\"--\"Kirkus Reviews\"<br>\" \"<br>\"Mystery and terror, the paranormal and romance--all combine to make \"Innocence \"a challenging and emotional experience.\"--\"New York Journal of Books\"<br>\" \"<br> \"This novel really is something special. . . . This may just be the book Dean Koontz was born to write.\"--\"Thriller Books Journal\" <br>\"Entrancing . . . as speedy a chase-thriller as any Koontz . . . has ever constructed. Written in Koontz' late mellifluent and reflective manner . . . [\"Innocence \"is] fueled by deep disgust with the world's evils [and] hope for redemption.\"--\"Booklist\" (starred review) <br> \"[An] imaginative, mystical thriller from bestseller Koontz . . . This is the most satisfying Koontz standalone in a while.\"--\"Publishers Weekly\" <br> \"Masterful storyteller Koontz delivers perhaps his most eerie and unusual tale to date. The timeline in this amazing story is compact, and readers will be swept along as they try to unravel hints and clues as to the true nature of both the protagonists and the unfolding drama. Unpredictably spine-chilling and terrifying, this is a story readers won't soon forget.\"--\"RT Book Reviews\"<br>\" \"<br> \"Elegant . . . Fans of Koontz's previous series will be left hoping that Addison and Gwyneth, too, will return.\"--\"Library Journal\"",

But Libertie, drawn more to music than science, feels stifled by her mother's choices and is hungry for something else--is there really only one way to have an autonomous life? And she is constantly reminded that, unlike her light-skinned mother, Libertie will not be able to pass for white. When a young man from Haiti proposes to Libertie and promises she will be his equal on the island, she accepts, only to discover that she is still subordinate to him and all men. As she tries to parse what freedom actually means for a Black woman, Libertie struggles with where she might find it--for herself and for generations to come. <p> Inspired by the life of one of the first Black female doctors in the United States and rich with historical detail, Kaitlyn Greenidge's new and immersive novel will resonate with readers eager to understand our present through a deep, moving, and lyrical dive into our past.",

Be Heard.</b>For seventeen-year-old Denver, music is everything. Writing, performing, and her ultimate goal: escaping her very small, very white hometown.So Denver is more than ready on the day she and her best friends Dali and Shak sing their way into the orbit of the biggest R&B star in the world, Sean \"Mercury\" Ellis. Merc gives them everything: parties, perks, wild nights -- plus hours and hours in the recording studio. Even the painful sacrifices and the lies the girls have to tell are all worth it.Until they're not.Denver begins to realize that she's trapped in Merc's world, struggling to hold on to her own voice. As the dream turns into a nightmare, she must make a choice: lose her big break, or get broken.Inspired by true events, <i>Muted </i>is a fearless exploration of the dark side of the music industry, the business of exploitation, how a girl's dreams can be used against her -- and what it takes to fight back.",

And Keiko thinks she's got it covered, especially with Audrey and Jenna by her side to shop for a new look, pick out a prime lunch spot, and even hit up that cute new bubble tea place after school. Her trio is ready to tackle life as they always have... together.But when Audrey decides they need boyfriends before Fall Ball, it looks like things may be changing in all the wrong ways. Jenna is sick of caving in to Audrey's demands, and soon Keiko's besties are barely talking, leaving her caught in the middle. While she's been dreaming about triple-dates, first kisses, and a boy she really shouldn't have a crush on, the friendship she's always thought was rock-solid is beginning to crumble.Keiko feels pulled in two directions. Should she try to help her friends -- even if it means losing one of them -- or follow her heart? When it comes to flirting, friendships, and fallouts, how is Keiko supposed to keep it all together?",

They live next door or across an ocean; they are innocent or experienced; their lyric explorations range from new love to stale love, obsession to ennui, ecstasy to heartbreak, and every nuance in between. Whether the romantic escapades described are touching, comical, or tragic, whether the feelings expressed are tender and sweet or brutal and biting, readers will find the love these young poets openly share to be exquisitely, excruciatingly, endlessly fascinating. Here is a collection to turn to again and again, because life and love keep on changing.",

Her best friend and cousin, Olivia, grew a foot over the summer and won a spot on the school\u2019s dance team, making her even more popular than last year. In the jungle that is middle school, Olivia is a gazelle and braces-wearing, manga-loving, uncoordinated Kat is a warthog. Plus, Tyler, Kat\u2019s next-door neighbor and buddy since birth, has morphed into a really cute boy. Suddenly the person Kat\u2019s used to playing Xbox with is causing her stomach to do cartwheels.<br> <br>When Olivia confesses she has a crush on Tyler and wants to ask him to the Fall Ball, Kat decides to be a good friend and squash her own feelings. After all, Olivia will need Kat\u2019s help to disprove Tyler\u2019s assumption that she\u2019s ditzy and only cares about lip gloss and boy bands. Kat\u2019s one of Tyler\u2019s oldest friends and can tell Olivia exactly how to get his attention.<br> <br>From writing \u201cTyler cheat sheets\u201d listing his favorite things to feeding Olivia lines through her headphones during Olivia and Tyler\u2019s study sessions, Kat devises schemes to make Tyler fall for Olivia. And to her delight\u2014or maybe horror\u2014her plan begins to work. Now that Olivia\u2019s caught Tyler\u2019s attention, Kat has to wonder if she\u2019s fooled Tyler into falling for the wrong girl. But what boy would ever choose a warthog over a gazelle?",

      "description": "In this comprehensive and entertaining resource, David Macaulay reveals the inner workings of the human body as only he could. In order to present this complicated subject in an accurate and entertaining way, he put in years of research. He sat in on anatomy classes, dissections, and even reached inside the rib cages of two cadavers to compare their spleen sizes. He observed numerous surgeries, including a ten-hour procedure where a diseased pancreas was removed, as well as one where a worn-out old knee was replaced by a brand new one. This hands-on investigation gives Macaulay a unique perspective to lead his readers on a visual journey through the workings of the human body.<br> <br> The seven sections within the book take us from the cells that form our foundation to the individual systems they build. Each beautifully illustrated spread details different aspects of our complex structure, explaining the function of each and offering up-close glimpses, unique cross-sections and perspectives, and even a little humor along the way.<br> This one-of-a-kind book can serve as a reference for children, families, teachers, and anyone who has questions about how his or her body works. When readers see how David Macaulay builds a body and explains the way it works, they will come away with a new appreciation of the amazing world inside them.",

This is the true story of one of those girls.<br> <br>In 2014, Chessy Prout was a freshman at St. Paul\u2019s School, a prestigious boarding school in New Hampshire, when a senior boy sexually assaulted her as part of a ritualized game of conquest. Chessy bravely reported her assault to the police and testified against her attacker in court. Then, in the face of unexpected backlash from her once-trusted school community, she shed her anonymity to help other survivors find their voice.<br> <br>This memoir is more than an account of a horrific event. It takes a magnifying glass to the institutions that turn a blind eye to such behavior and a society that blames victims rather than perpetrators. Chessy\u2019s story offers real, powerful solutions to upend rape culture as we know it today. Prepare to be inspired by this remarkable young woman and her story of survival, advocacy, and hope in the face of unspeakable trauma.",

Even though she was the daughter of the emperor, Izta had no desire to marry a man of wealth and power. Instead, she fell in love with Popoca, a brave warrior who fought in her father\u2019s army\u2014and a man who did not offer her riches but a promise to stay by her side forever.<br> <br> The emperor did not want his daughter to marry a mere warrior, but he recognized Popoca\u2019s bravery. He offered Popoca a deal: If the warrior could defeat their enemy, Jaguar Claw, then the emperor would permit Popoca and Izta to wed. But Jaguar Claw had a plan to thwart the warrior. Would all be lost?<br> <br> Today two majestic volcanoes\u2014Popocat\u00e9petl and Iztacc\u00edhuatl\u2014stand overlooking Mexico City. They have been admired and revered for countless generations and have formed the basis of many origin and creation myths.<br> <br> The integration of Nahuatl words (defined with a pronunciation guide in the glossary) into the narrative provides a rich opportunity to introduce and explore another facet of ancient Aztec culture.

His older sister, Beth, thought he was dead. His childhood friend Josh thought it was all his fault. They were the last two people to see him alive. <p> Until now. Because Sam has been found, and he's coming home. Beth desperately wants to understand what happened to her brother, but her family refuses to talk about it--even though Sam is clearly still affected by the abuse he faced at the hands of his captor. <p> And as Sam starts to confide in Josh about his past, Josh can't admit the truths he's hidden deep within himself: that he's gay, and developing feelings for Sam. And, even bigger: that he never told the police everything he saw the day Sam disappeared. <p> As Beth and Josh struggle with their own issues, their friends and neighbors slowly turn on Sam, until one night when everything explodes. Beth can't live in silence. Josh can't live with his secrets. And Sam can't continue on until the whole truth of what happened to him is out in the open. <p> For fans of thought-provoking stories like <i>The Face on the Milk Carton</i>, this is a book about learning to be an ally--even when the community around you doesn't want you to be.",

Claire Wang never thought she\u2019d be one of them, until her parents pluck her from her privileged life in Shanghai and enroll her at a high school in California.</p><p>Suddenly she finds herself living in a stranger\u2019s house, with no one to tell her what to do for the first time in her life. She soon embraces her newfound freedom,\u00a0especially when the hottest and most eligible parachute, Jay, asks her out.</p><p>Dani De La Cruz, Claire\u2019s new host sister, couldn\u2019t be less thrilled that her mom rented out a room to Claire. An academic and debate team star, Dani is determined to earn her way into Yale, even if it means competing with privileged kids who are buying their way to the top. But Dani\u2019s game plan veers unexpectedly off course when her debate coach starts working with her privately.</p><p>As they steer their own distinct paths, Dani and Claire keep crashing into one another, setting a course that will change their lives forever.\u00a0</p>",

      "description": "<b>Universally acclaimed, rapturously reviewed, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for autobiography, and an instant <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, Chanel Miller's breathtaking memoir \"gives readers the privilege of knowing her not just as Emily Doe, but as Chanel Miller the writer, the artist, the survivor, the fighter.\" (<i>The Wrap</i>).<br><br>\"I opened <i>Know My Name</i> with the intention to bear witness to the story of a survivor. Instead, I found myself falling into the hands of one of the great writers and thinkers of our time. Chanel Miller is a philosopher, a cultural critic, a deep observer, a writer's writer, a true artist. I could not put this phenomenal book down.\" --Glennon Doyle, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Love Warrior</i> and <i>Untamed</i><br><br>\"<i>Know My Name</i> is a gut-punch, and in the end, somehow, also blessedly hopeful.\" --<i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br>She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral--viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.<br><br>Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways--there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.<br><br><i>Know My Name</i> will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.<br><br>Chosen as a BEST BOOK OF 2019 by <i>The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, TIME, Elle, Glamour, Parade, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, BookRiot</i>",

Ariah, \"the Widow Bride of the Falls,\" begins a relentless seven-day vigil in the mist, waiting for his body to be found. At her side is confirmed bachelor and pillar of the community Dirk Burnaby, who is unexpectedly drawn to this plain, strange woman. What follows is a passionate love affair, marriage, and family\u2014a seemingly perfect existence. But the tragedy by which they were thrown together begins to shadow them, damaging their idyll with distrust, greed, and even murder. </p> <p> Set against the mythic-historic backdrop of Niagara Falls in the mid-twentieth century, this haunting exploration of the American family in crisis is a stunning achievement from \"one of the great artistic forces of our time\" (<i>The Nation</i>). </p>",

One is named the prettiest, one the ugliest. The girls who aren't picked are quickly forgotten. The girls who are become the center of attention, and each reacts differently to the experience. With THE LIST, Siobhan Vivian deftly takes you into the lives of eight very different girls struggling with issues of identity, self-esteem, and the judgments of their peers. Prettiest or ugliest, once you're on the list, you'll never be the same.",

      "description": "<p>It was the 1960s\u2013\u2013a time of economic boom and social strife. Young women poured into the workplace, but the \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d ads were segregated by gender and the \u201cMad Men\u201d office culture was rife with sexual stereotyping and discrimination.</p><p>Lynn Povich was one of the lucky ones, landing a job at <i>Newsweek</i>, renowned for its cutting-edge coverage of civil rights and the \u201cSwinging Sixties.\u201d Nora Ephron, Jane Bryant Quinn, Ellen Goodman, and Susan Brownmiller all started there as well. It was a top-notch job\u2013\u2013for a girl\u2013\u2013at an exciting place.</p><p>But it was a dead end. Women researchers sometimes became reporters, rarely writers, and never editors. Any aspiring female journalist was told, \u201cIf you want to be a writer, go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>On March 16, 1970, the day <i>Newsweek </i>published a cover story on the fledgling feminist movement entitled \u201cWomen in Revolt,\u201d forty-six <i>Newsweek </i>women charged the magazine with discrimination in hiring and promotion. It was the first female class action lawsuit\u2013\u2013the first by women journalists\u2013\u2013and it inspired other women in the media to quickly follow suit.</p><p>Lynn Povich was one of the ringleaders. In <i>The Good Girls Revolt</i>, she evocatively tells the story of this dramatic turning point through the lives of several participants. With warmth, humor, and perspective, she shows how personal experiences and cultural shifts led a group of well-mannered, largely apolitical women, raised in the 1940s and 1950s, to challenge their bosses\u2013\u2013and what happened after they did. For many, filing the suit was a radicalizing act that empowered them to \u201cfind themselves\u201d and fight back. Others lost their way amid opportunities, pressures, discouragements, and hostilities they weren't prepared to navigate. </p><p><i>The Good Girls Revolt </i>also explores why changes in the law didn't solve everything. Through the lives of young female journalists at <i>Newsweek </i>today, Lynn Povich shows what has\u2013\u2013and hasn't\u2013\u2013changed in the workplace.<br> </p>",

A few, actually. She just quit her well paid job to focus on her secret career as a romance writer. She hasn\u2019t told her family and now has terrible writer\u2019s block. Then, the ceiling of her New York apartment literally crumbles on her. Luckily she has her best friend Lina\u2019s spare key while she\u2019s out of town. But Rosie doesn\u2019t know that Lina has already lent her apartment to her cousin Lucas, who Rosie has been stalking\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014on Instagram for the last few months. Lucas seems intent on coming to her rescue like a Spanish knight in shining armor. Only this one strolls around the place in a towel, has a distracting grin, and an irresistible accent. Oh, and he cooks.<br> <br>Lucas offers to let Rosie stay with him, at least until she can find some affordable temporary housing. And then he proposes an outrageous experiment to bring back her literary muse and meet her deadline: He\u2019ll take her on a series of experimental dates meant to jump-start her romantic inspiration. Rosie has nothing to lose. Her silly, online crush is totally under control\u2014but Lucas\u2019s time in New York has an expiration date, and six weeks may not be enough, for either her or her deadline.",

      "description": "A wedding. A trip to Spain. The most infuriating man. And three days of pretending. Or in other words, a plan that will never work. Catalina Marti \u0301n, finally, not single. Her family is happy to announce that she will bring her American boyfriend to her sister's wedding. Everyone is invited to come and witness the most magical event of the year. That would certainly be tomorrow's headline in the local newspaper of the small Spanish town I came from. Or the epitaph on my tombstone, seeing the turn my life had taken in the span of a phone call. Four weeks wasn't a lot of time to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic-from NYC and all the way to Spain-for a wedding. Let alone, someone eager to play along with my charade. But that didn't mean I was desperate enough to bring the 6'4 blue eyed pain in my ass standing before me, Aaron Blackford. The man whose main occupation was making my blood boil had just offered himself to be my date. Right after inserting his nose in my business, calling me delusional, and calling himself my best option. See? Outrageous. Aggravating. Blood boiling. And much to my total despair, also right. Which left me with a surly and extra large dilemma in my hands. Was it worth the suffering to bring my colleague and bane of my existence as my fake boyfriend to my sister's wedding? Or was I better off coming clean and facing the consequences of my panic induced lie? Like my abuela would say, que dios nos pille confesados.",

He doesn\u2019t believe in true love, and only agreed to the show as a last-ditch effort to rehabilitate his image. In front of the cameras, he\u2019s a stiff, anxious mess with no idea how to date twenty women on national television. Behind the scenes, he\u2019s cold, awkward, and emotionally closed-off.<br> <br> As Dev fights to get Charlie to connect with the contestants on a whirlwind, worldwide tour, they begin to open up to each other, and Charlie realizes he has better chemistry with Dev than with any of his female co-stars. But even reality TV has a script, and in order to find to happily ever after, they\u2019ll have to reconsider whose love story gets told.",

Contributions include essays from established and up-and-coming writers, performers, and critics, including actors Ally Sheedy and Gabrielle Union and writers Amy Jo Burns, Lyz Lenz, Claire Schwartz, and Bob Shacochis. Covering a wide range of topics and experiences, from an exploration of the rape epidemic embedded in the refugee crisis to first-person accounts of child molestation, this collection is often deeply personal and is always unflinchingly honest. Like Rebecca Solnit\u2019s Men Explain Things to Me, Not That Bad will resonate with every reader, saying \u201csomething in totality that we cannot say alone.\u201d</p><p>Searing and heartbreakingly candid, this provocative collection both reflects the world we live in and offers a call to arms insisting that \u201cnot that bad\u201d must no longer be good enough. </p>",

Specifically designed to help young adults aged 16-19 make their own decisions about sexuality, Sexual Decisions is not only about the facts of sexual health, but it also delves into the feelings and emotions that surround sex. The philosophy of this book is: _ Teens have a right to ask questions and get answers. _ Teens already know a lot about sex and relationships, but not all there is to know. _ Teens are going to make decisions for themselves about sex. Having access to information can help them make better, safer decisions. _ No question should be left unanswered. The information included in this book is relevant to the lives of teens but includes topics that are not often discussed. It provides an education about sex that is practical, and gives teens a sense of what is going on 'out there'_in other people and the worlds of research and politics_as well as inside themselves.",

He is determined to know the truth about what he believes was her murder. He hires crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist, recently at the wrong end of a libel case, to get to the bottom of Harriet's disappearance. Lisbeth Salander, a twenty-four-year-old, pierced, tattooed genius hacker, possessed of the hard-earned wisdom of someone twice her age--and a terrifying capacity for ruthlessness--assists Blomkvist with the investigation. This unlikely team discovers a vein of nearly unfathomable iniquity running through the Vanger family, an astonishing corruption at the highest echelon of Swedish industrialism--and a surprising connection between themselves.--From publisher description.",

      "description": "<b>From a leading journalist and activist comes a brave, beautifully wrought memoir.</b><br><br> When Darnell Moore was fourteen, three boys from his neighborhood tried to set him on fire. They cornered him while he was walking home from school, harassed him because they thought he was gay, and poured a jug of gasoline on him. He escaped, but just barely. It wasn't the last time he would face death.<br><br> Three decades later, Moore is an award-winning writer, a leading Black Lives Matter activist, and an advocate for justice and liberation. In <i>No Ashes in the Fire</i>, he shares the journey taken by that scared, bullied teenager who not only survived, but found his calling. Moore's transcendence over the myriad forces of repression that faced him is a testament to the grace and care of the people who loved him, and to his hometown, Camden, NJ, scarred and ignored but brimming with life. Moore reminds us that liberation is possible if we commit ourselves to fighting for it, and if we dream and create futures where those who survive on society's edges can thrive.<i><br><br><i>No Ashes in the Fire</i> is a story of beauty and hope-and an honest reckoning with family, with place, and with what it means to be free.",

Fantastic\" (<i>Library Journal</i>, Starred Review).</b> <p> This graphic biography documents the brief and intense period of creativity Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) spent in Arles, Provence, in southern France. Here van Gogh dreams of setting up an artists' studio--a haven where he and his friends can paint together. But attacks of mental illness leave the painter confused and disoriented. <p> When his friend and fellow artist Paul Gauguin refuses to reside permanently at the Yellow House, a distraught van Gogh cuts off part of his own ear. Throughout this period of intense emotion and hardship, Vincent's brother, Theo, stands by him, offering constant and unconditional support. Writer and illustrator Barbara Stok breathes riveting new life into a fascinating episode of art history, creating a vivid portrait of one of the world's most beloved and legendary artists. <br><b>\"Stylistically, Stok is almost faultless . . . [<i>Vincent</i>] leaves us aware of a small breath of fresh air blown into the world of art history.\" --<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b> <p><b>\"Stok does a brilliant, sympathetic job of picturing the artist, whether jagged with madness or sitting amid the wheat fields and sunflowers of Arles.\" --<i>Guardian</i></b>",

Though Mama Shannon fought hard to keep Fella, it was no use. The marriage act is still a few years away and the courts thought Fella would be better off with a blood relation.

      "description": "<b>Newbery Medalist Richard Peck tells a story of small-town life, gay marriage, and everyday heroes in this novel for fans of Gary Schmidt and Jack Gantos.</b><br><br>Archer Magill has spent a lively five years of grade school with one eye out in search of grown-up role models. Three of the best are his grandpa, the great architect; his dad, the great vintage car customizer,; and his uncle Paul, who is just plain great. These are the three he wants to be. Along the way he finds a fourth\u2014Mr. McLeod, a teacher. In fact, the first male teacher in the history of the school.<br><br> But now here comes middle school and puberty. Change. Archer wonders how much change has to happen before his voice does. He doesn't see too far ahead, so every day or so a startling revelation breaks over him. Then a really big one when he's the best man at the wedding of two of his role models. But that gets ahead of the story.<br><br>In pages that ripple with laughter, there's a teardrop here and there. And more than a few insights about the bewildering world of adults, made by a boy on his way to being the best man he can be.<br><br><b>Boston Globe Horn Honor Book </b><br><b>Amazon Editors\u2019 Picks for Fall</b>\u00a0(Ages 9-12)<br><b><i>New York Times</i>\u00a0Notable Children's Book<br><i>Horn Book</i>\u00a0Fanfare<br><i>School Library Journal</i>\u00a0Best Books of 2016<br><i>Kirkus</i>\u00a0Best Books of 2016<br>Chicago Public Library Best Books of 2016</b>",

Guided by Lord Henry Wotton, he embarks on a life of corruption, satisfying his desires while still appearing as a respectable gentleman to society. Only Dorian's portrait shows the signs of his moral decline.<br><br>An insightful depiction of a hidden life and a critique of the darker facets of late Victorian society, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> provides a chilling portrayal of a man confronting the reality of his soul. Shocking in its implications of forbidden transgressions, this novel was later used as evidence against Oscar Wilde during his 1895 trial for indecency.",

      "description": "There are two sides to every story. Rosalyn Schanzer's engaging and wonderfully illustrated book brings to life both sides of the American Revolution. <p>The narrative introduces anew the two enemies, both named George: George Washington, the man who freed the American colonies from the British, and George III, the British king who lost them. Two leaders on different sides of the Atlantic, yet with more in common than we sometimes acknowledge. We are lead through their story, and the story of their times, and see both sides of the arguments that divided the colonies from the Kingdom. Was King George a \"Royal Brute\" as American patriots claimed? Or was he, as others believed, \"the father of the people?\" Was George Washington a scurrilous traitor, as all the king's supporters claimed? Or should we remember and celebrate him as \"the father of his country?\" Who was right? History teaches us that there are two sides to every story. <p>Rosalyn Schanzer's book is an accessible account of one the most vital periods in American history. It is also a timeless lesson in seeing history from different points of view. The author spent two years researching books, paintings, cartoons, and descriptions of Revolutionary times. She uses art, text, and first-hand accounts to illustrate how history should never be reduced to simplistic conflicts between the \"good guys\" and the \"bad guys.\" Her illustrations, and her engaging quote bubbles, bring the Revolution to life again, and allow the characters of the period to speak for themselves. Through its lively text, detailed illustrations, and fully authenticated quotes, <i>George vs. George</i> shines fresh light on both sides of the story of our country's formative years.",

Emiko is not human; she is an engineered being, grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in this chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe.<br><br>What happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits and forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? Bacigalupi delivers one of the most highly-acclaimed science fiction novels of the twenty-first century.<br><br>In this brand new edition celebrating the book\u2019s reception into the canon of celebrated modern science fiction, accompanying the text are two novelettes exploring the dystopian world of The Windup Girl, the Theodore Sturgeon Award-winning \u201cThe Calorie Man\u201d and \u201cYellow Card Man.\u201d Also included are course-work questions for use in the classroom, and an exclusive Q&A with the author describing his writing process, the political climate into which his debut novel was published, and the future of science fiction.",

In her first book, <i>Be Loved</i>, she invites readers to join her on a journey of life-changing faith and the freedom that comes from knowing the love of God.</p> <p>She chronicles her own high school journey through starting a new school, navigating the typical pressures of school work and sports, going to prom, and even homecoming. Emma Mae faced each new challenge with the confidence that God was with her and was going to make her uniquely useful in the place he had prepared for her.</p> <p>For Emma Mae, it all starts with her relationship with Jesus. Because she knows she is loved by him, she is free to be herself and to live out her faith no matter what the cost. As a young, passionate, and intimate lover of Jesus, Emma Mae's love for her Savior overflows unashamedly into her unconditional, fierce love for people.</p> <p>Readers will experience the chain-breaking liberty of knowing the Lord's presence and the freedom to be unique. This full-color, hardback book includes pictures from Emma Mae's life, along with key Bible verses that God used to strengthen and guide her through the ups and downs of her high school years. Readers will learn to face the challenges of their student years with faith, courage, hope, and lifegiving love for others.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Captured by ISIS, her bravery and faith became her pathway to freedom. </p> <p></p> <p>Badeeah Hassan was just 18 when she witnessed firsthand the horrors of the 2014 genocide of the Yazidi people by ISIS forces. Captured by ISIS, known locally as <i>Daesh</i>, Badeeah was among hundreds forced into a brutal human trafficking network made up of women and girls of Yazidi ethnicity, a much-persecuted minority culture of Iraq. Badeeah\u2019s story takes her to Syria where she is sold to a high-ranking ISIS commander known as Al Amriki, <i>the American</i>, kept as a house slave, raped, and routinely assaulted. Only the presence of her young nephew Eivan and her friend Navine, also prisoners, keeps her from harming herself. In captivity, she draws on memories and stories from her childhood to maintain a small bit of control in an otherwise volatile situation. Ultimately, it is her profound sense of faith and brave resistance that lead her to escape with Eivan and reunite with family.</p> <p></p> <p>Since her escape, Badeeah has brought her harrowing story of war and survival to the world\u2019s stage, raising awareness about the strength of her people and the acts of genocide against them. This captivating account of courage extends beyond the confines of her experience; Badeeah\u2019s story is about the resilience of women, girls, and persecuted groups everywhere in the face of seemingly insurmountable oppression.</p>",

It doesn\u2019t hurt that their families are the modern day, Californian version of the Montagues and Capulets.<br> <br>But when a group camping trip goes south, Zorie and Lennon find themselves stranded in the wilderness. Alone. Together.<br> <br>What could go wrong?<br> <br>With no one but each other for company, Zorie and Lennon have no choice but to hash out their issues via witty jabs and insults as they try to make their way to safety. But fighting each other while also fighting off the forces of nature makes getting out of the woods in one piece less and less likely.<br> <br>And as the two travel deeper into Northern California\u2019s rugged backcountry, secrets and hidden feelings surface. But can Zorie and Lennon\u2019s rekindled connection survive out in the real world? Or was it just a result of the fresh forest air and the magic of the twinkling stars?",

An opportunity to escape appears. And I'm going to take it. I'm going to use four so-called perfect guys in this new town to make it happen. The ones that have it all, or so everyone thinks.

I finally have some freedom to enjoy my senior year without feeling like I'm slowly suffocating under the twisted morals and warped expectations of my parents.

Something's wrong with Jonah. No matter how I push, he's not letting me or the guys in to help. Then there's the tension between Thatcher and Beck. Not to mention the sudden change in my friendship with Rhys. How do you stay afloat when the ugly truths emerge from the pretty lies? You don't.",

But this great opportunity coincides with a lot of internal doubt and the disturbing news that her long-estranged grandmother has fallen ill and may be near death. As Caprice tries to figure out her future, she is pulled back toward her past, and the abuse she endured from her uncle when she was little -- an abuse she's never told anyone about.</p><p>With extreme sensitivity and honesty for middle-grade readers, Coe Booth has written a painful but ultimately healing novel about finding support from your parents and friends, articulating your truth, and choosing your own path.</p>",

Honesty is for suckers, like the oh-so-<i>not</i> charming Prince Cyrus, who plans to strip Violet of her official role once he\u2019s crowned at the end of the summer\u2014unless Violet does something about it.<br><br>But when the king asks her to falsely prophesy Cyrus's love story for an upcoming ball, Violet awakens a dreaded curse, one that will end in either damnation or salvation for the kingdom\u2014all depending on the prince\u2019s choice of future bride. Violet faces her own choice: Seize an opportunity to gain control of her own destiny, no matter the cost, or give in to the ill-fated attraction that\u2019s growing between her and Cyrus.<br><br>Violet\u2019s wits may protect her in the cutthroat court, but they can't change her fate. And as the boundary between hatred and love grows ever thinner with the prince, Violet must untangle a wicked web of deceit in order to save herself and the kingdom\u2014or doom them all.",

      "description": "Despite the fact that the United Nations officially abolished slavery and the slave trade almost 60 years ago, millions of human beings live in slavery today. Human trafficking - the official term for modern-day slavery - consists of buying and selling people with the intent of exploiting them through forced labor or sexual acts. Human Trafficking provides a thorough and much-needed examination of this controversial and timely topic. It describes the suffering caused by human trafficking as well as the financial, cultural, and other conditions that make trafficking within national borders and between far-flung 'origin' and 'destination' countries possible. The efforts of the United Nations, national governments, and non-governmental organizations to combat human trafficking are thoroughly discussed, as are efforts to provide direct aid to the individual victims of human trafficking. This new title examines how human trafficking is conducted in the United States, the Netherlands, Nigeria, India, and Belize. Each case study analyzes the patterns of trade and types of exploitation, the reasons countries have failed to halt human trafficking, and the steps taken by governments and organizations to reduce trafficking.",

And when Peyton's involvement in a drunk driving episode sends him to jail, Sydney feels increasingly rootless and invisible, worried that her parents are unconcerned about the real victim: the boy Peyton hit and seriously injured. Meanwhile, Sydney becomes friends with the Chathams, a warm, close-knit, eccentric family, and their friendship helps her understand that she is not responsible for Peyton's mistakes. Once again, the hugely popular Sarah Dessen tells an engrossing story of a girl discovering friendship, love, and herself.</p><p><b>\"This summer I'm looking forward to reading Saint Anything by Sarah Dessen.\"--John Green</b><br><br><b>\"The name Sarah Dessen has become synonymous with Young Adult contemporary fiction.\"--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b></p><p><br>Sarah Dessen is the winner of the Margaret A.

Maddie's plans change the instant Gram announces that she is terminally ill and has booked the family on a secret \"death with dignity\" cruise ship so that she can leave the world in her own unconventional way - and give the O'Neill clan an unforgettable summer of dreams-come-true in the process.<br><br> Soon, Maddie is on the trip of a lifetime with her over-the-top family. As they travel the globe, Maddie bonds with other passengers and falls for Enzo, who is processing his own grief.

Perfect for fans of </b><i><b>To All The Boys I've Loved Before</b></i><b>. </b><br> <br> Mansfield, Massachusetts, is the last place seventeen-year-old Edie Price wants to spend her final summer before college. It's the home of wealthy suburban mothers and prima donnas like Edie's cousins, who are determined to distract her from her mother's death with cute boys and Cinderella-style makeovers. She's got her own plans, and they don't include any prince charming.<br> <br> But as she dives into schoolwork and getting a scholarship for college, Edie finds herself drawn to two Mansfield boys strumming for her attention: First, there's Sebastian, Edie's childhood friend and first love, who's sweet and smart and . . . already has a girlfriend. Then there's Henry, the local bad boy and all-around player who's totally off limits--even if his kisses are chemically addictive.<br> <br> Both boys are trouble. Edie can't help herself from being caught between them. Now, she just has to make sure it isn't her heart that breaks in the process.",

      "description": "<p><b>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kristin Hannah comes a powerful novel of love, loss, and the magic of friendship. . . . now a #1 Netflix series!<br></b><br>In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all\u2014beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become <i>TullyandKate.</i> Inseparable.<br><br>So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, <i>Firefly Lane</i> is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.<br><br>From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. <br><br>Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend. . . .<br><br>For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship\u2014jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.<br><br><i>Firefly Lane</i> is for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you\u2014and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. <i>Firefly Lane </i>is a story you'll never forget . . . one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.</p>",

Raised on an idyllic island by loving foster parents, Sid would be content to stay there forever, drawing, riding his bike, hanging out with his friend Chloe and helping out with Fariza, a newly arrived foster child. But when a stranger named Phil arrives on the island with disturbing news about his birth family \u2013 including a troubled younger brother \u2013 Sid leaves all that is familiar to help find the sibling he didn't know existed. What he discovers is a family fractured by mental illness, but also united by strong bonds of love and compassion. As Sid searches for his brother, gets to know his grandmother, and worries about meeting his biological mother, he realizes that there will never be a simple answer to the question, Am I my brother's keeper?",

And me wanting nothing else but to run crying into my own mom's room and have her do the whole thing.<br> It's not going to happen....</b> <br> Bobby is your classic urban teenaged boy -- impulsive, eager, restless. On his sixteenth birthday he gets some news from his girlfriend, Nia, that changes his life forever. She's pregnant. Bobby's going to be a father. Suddenly things like school and house parties and hanging with friends no longer seem important as they're replaced by visits to Nia's obstetrician and a social worker who says that the only way for Nia and Bobby to lead a normal life is to put their baby up for adoption. <br> With powerful language and keen insight, Johnson looks at the male side of teen pregnancy as she delves into one young man's struggle to figure out what \"the right thing\" is and then to do it. No matter what the cost.",

It's true that no one can guess his hidden thoughts, which are hilarious, razor-sharp observations about lust, love, tubas, algebra, everything. And then there's his home: his father ran off years ago, so he's being raised by his mother, who works long hours, and by her boyfriend, whom John calls \"the man who is not and never will be my father.\" This man is his enemy, an abusive disciplinarian who seems to want to kill John and, in a horrible final confrontation, nearly succeeds.</p>",

I will be waiting for you at 5 p.m. Friday by the windmill hole at the crazy golf at the Pier where we played once. If you still want me then, when you're done reading this, come and get me. OK? Consider this the most screwed up love letter ever.'</i><br><i></i><br>So begins Nick Lake's brilliant <i>tour de force</i> romance which introduces readers to Cassie, a New Jersey Shore teen who, over the course of one summer, experiences the exhilarating highs of new love, the frightening free falls of personal demons and family tragedy, and the bumps along the way to forgiveness, acceptance, and self-discovery. Told entirely through flashbacks, readers will savour every moment of Cassie's relationship with a boardwalk boy and race to the last page to discover how it all ends.",

Good guys understand that no means no, and so I could not have done this because I understand.\"</b> <br> <br> Keir Sarafian knows many things about himself. He is a talented football player, a loyal friend, a devoted son and brother. Most of all, he is a good guy. <br> <br> And yet the love of his life thinks otherwise. Gigi says Keir has done something awful. Something unforgivable. <br> <br> Keir doesn't understand. He loves Gigi. He would never do anything to hurt her. So Keir carefully recounts the events leading up to that one fateful night, in order to uncover the truth. Clearly, there has been a mistake. <br> <br> But what has happened is, indeed, something inexcusable.",

Best friends Suze, Nikki, Ani, and Lydia swear they'll always have each other's backs against predatory guys--so when Suze suddenly starts dating wrestling star and toxic douchebag Tarkin Shaw, it's a big betrayal.</p> <p>Turns out, it's not a relationship--it's blackmail. At first, Suze feels like she has no choice but to go along with it, but when Tarkin starts demanding more, she enlists the help of intelligent misfits DeShawn and Marcus to beat Tarkin at his own game. As Marcus points out, what could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>The answer: everything. And by the time the teens realize they're fighting against forces much bigger than the Tarkin Shaws of the world, losing isn't an option.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945. The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon.</p><p>According to Orwell, the fable reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin (\"un conte satirique contre Staline\"), and in his essay \"Why I Write\" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

The only world he knows is one of isolation and fear. Although others had rescued this boy from his abusive alcoholic mother, his real hurt is just begining -- he has no place to call home. </p> <p>This is Dave Pelzer's long-awaited sequel to A Child Called \"It\". In The Lost Boy, he answers questions and reveals new adventures through the compelling story of his life as an adolescent. Now considered an F-Child (Foster Child), Dave is moved in and out of five different homes. He suffers shame and experiences resentment from those who feel that all foster kids are trouble and unworthy of being loved just because they are not part of a \"real\" family. </p> <p>Tears, laughter, devastation and hope create the journey of this little lost boy who searches desperately for just one thing -- the love of a family.</p>",

      "description": "<b>New town, new friends, new guy . . . and an old bucket list. The past haunts the present in the newest installation in the <i>Love, Lucas</i> universe.</b><br><br> After her dad is sentenced to prison time, seventeen-year-old Lucy Nelson and her mother move across the country to start over in the town\u2014and farmhouse\u2014where her mother grew up. <br><br> Once settled, Lucy is determined to keep her mind off anything \u201creal\u201d and decides to pass the time by reading a stack of her mother\u2019s childhood books, which has sat in her grandmother\u2019s home for decades. When Lucy finds her mom\u2019s old summer bucket list shoved between the pages of a worn copy of <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, she\u2019s eager to write her own list to escape her inevitable summer boredom. Feeling brave, she fills it with challenges she\u2019d never normally do and also adds the one thing that her mother had never crossed off the original list: Visit Susan\u2019s grave.<br><br> When Lucy befriends Mira and her handsome cousin, Jack, she begins to feel almost normal as they help check off her list. When she asks her mother about Susan, she refuses to talk about her. As Lucy falls for Jack, she yearns to tell him the truth about her dad and her old life but lies about everything instead. When her friends see through the lies and her mom reaches her breaking point over questions about Susan, Lucy must learn to trust her friends, try to bring peace to her mother, and to somehow find the courage to forgive her dad.",

Soon, a horrifying truth is revealed. She is fated to be Snow White\u2019s greatest enemy, the Evil Queen.<br><br>With powers beyond her imagination or control, Everly returns to the land of her birth. There, she meets Roth Charmaine, the supposed Prince Charming. Their attraction is undeniable, but their relationship is doomed. As Everly faces disasters and betrayals, giving in to her wicked side proves more tempting. Can she resist, or will she become the villain she was born to be?<br><br>Critics love The Evil Queen:<br><br>\u201cShowalter (the Everlife books) delivers an entertaining series opener that condemns prejudice while championing self-determination.

It was an unpopular dream for most young girls, but her hard work paid off and at age eighteen, Polo started basic training at the United States Air Force Academy.<br><br>She does everything right, from academics to athletics. But no one prepared her for what came next: physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of her superiors. Harassment from peers who refused to believe her story. <br><br><i>Deep Dark Blue</i> is more than a memoir about sexual assault. It\u2019s about breaking boundaries but also setting them. It's about learning to trust your instincts. It's a story of survival, resilience, and finally, finding your joy.</p>",

Low-level teen fiction tackling tough and gritty topics like foster care, rape, teen pregnancy and more. Series contains a silver medal winner for the Independent Publishers Book Award. Each eBook is approximately 200-pages. Lexile Levels: 390 to 400. Whatever happens, school comes first. Her mother said it like she meant it. These words played over and over again in Dani Garcia's head. But life got in the way. There were mouths to feed and rent to pay. Plus someone had to watch baby Benny. Dani knew adversity, but she was the kind of strong that comes from within: strong mind, body, and soul. Then a horrible rape and its powerful aftermath threaten to bring Dani's life crashing down-- forever. She's trapped in a reality that she cannot control, but she gains the strength to never back down and finally has faith in her own power.",

And after seeing her sister go through one too many heartbreaks, she definitely has no interest in dating. Hadley just wants to keep her head down and enjoy the rest of high school with her friends, focusing on her photography and getting into the art school of her dreams. <br><br>Then enters Braden, star of the swim team and precisely the kind of person Hadley avoids, all bravado and charm and impulsivity. From their first moment together, they are perfect sparring partners, equally matched. And it's intoxicating. Braden sees her, really sees her, and Hadley decides it might be time to break all her rules. <br><br>Braden shows Hadley how to live again, and soon Hadley is happier than she'll ever admit out loud. But that's before her family is faced with devastating news, and Braden starts hiding a growing, dark secret. As it threatens to shatter everything they've built, Hadley must confront her own actions and determine if she has the strength to walk away.",

She\u2019s shared everything with him, from adventures with their families and days lounging at the beach to long talks about their friends and her journey with type 1 diabetes.

Determined to make the most of the time they still have left, they come up with a list of things they want to do together before graduation.</p><p>But as they make their way through everything from toilet papering the school bully\u2019s house to having a backyard camp-out like the ones they had when they were kids, Mackenzie can\u2019t help feeling that she\u2019s left the most important thing off the list: telling Nolan how she feels.</p><p>Confessing her love could jeopardize the incredible relationship they already have.

      "description": "\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" is considered by many to be the greatest of all American novels. This sequel to Twain's \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\" is a first person narrative told by its title character. The novel picks up where \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" leaves off. Huck Finn who is now wealthy with the discovery of treasure at the end of \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" finds himself in great danger from his abusive drunkard father who wishes to cash in on Huck's fortune. Fearing for his life Huck believes that he must run away from his home with the Widow Douglas and her Sister, Miss Watson. Huck fakes his own death and escapes to Jackson's Island. There he finds Miss Watson's escaped slave, Jim. Together they escape down the Mississippi River on a raft. \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" is a story told in the time of slavery with language that embodies the regional dialects that are common to Twain's work and the Mississippi River Valley in which Twain grew up. The novel is as much a biting and satirical commentary on slavery, religion, and civilized society as it is a light-hearted comedy and buddy travel story through Midwestern 19th century America. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes an introduction by Brander Matthews.",

A courageous, heart-wrenching account.\u201d\u2014Jon Krakauer</b><br>\u00a0<br>When she was eighteen years old, Carolyn Jessop was coerced into an arranged marriage with a total stranger: a man thirty-two years her senior. Merril Jessop already had three wives. But arranged plural marriages were an integral part of Carolyn\u2019s heritage: She was born into and raised in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), the radical offshoot of the Mormon Church. Over the next fifteen years, Carolyn had eight children and withstood her husband\u2019s psychological abuse and the watchful eyes of his other wives, who were locked in a constant battle for supremacy. Carolyn was miserable for years and wanted out, but she knew that if she tried to leave and got caught, her children would be taken away from her. In 2003, Carolyn chose freedom over fear and fled her home with her eight children. She had $20 to her name.<br>\u00a0<br><i>Escape </i>exposes a world tantamount to a prison camp, created by religious fanatics who, in the name of God, deprive the followers the right to make choices, brainwash children in church-run schools, and force women to be totally subservient to men. Against this background, Carolyn\u2019s flight takes on an extraordinary, inspiring power.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Not only did Carolyn manage a daring escape from a brutal environment, she became the first woman ever granted full custody of her children in a contested suit involving the FLDS. And in 2006, her reports to the Utah attorney general on church abuses formed a crucial part of the case that led to the arrest, and later the conviction and sentence, of their notorious leader, Warren Jeffs.",

Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by a longing for his mother, he clings to the one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into a wealthy and insular art community. As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love \u2014 and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. <br> \u00a0 <i>The Goldfinch</i> is a mesmerizing, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention. From the streets of New York to the dark corners of the art underworld, this \"soaring masterpiece\" examines the devastating impact of grief and the ruthless machinations of fate (Ron Charles, <i>Washington Post</i>). \u00a0",

The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice\"--Wikipedia, viewed November 2, 2020.",

She's the founding (and only) member of NOLAW, the National Organization to Liberate All Weirdos. Emily wears sweaters with faux pearl buttons. She's vice president of the student council. She has a boyfriend. <br><br> These two girls have nothing in common, except the passionate \"private time\" they share every Tuesday afternoon. Jesse wishes their relationship could be out in the open, but Emily feels she has too much to lose. When they find themselves on opposite sides of a heated school conflict, they each have to decide what's more important: what you believe in, or the one you love?",

There was no play she couldn't shut down. But now the biggest threat on the field is one of her teammates . . . who is also Addie's former best friend. When Eva Riley moved to town, she and Addie became super close. But when Eva wanted to be more than friends, Addie put soccer first instead. Suddenly Eva's sending Addie mean notes. Then she's screwing up Addie's plays. After a while, Addie's not sure she even wants her friend back. She has to worry about other things\u2014like keeping her spot on the team after Eva's latest act of sabotage.</p>",

So now that he\u2019s finally managed to (somewhat clumsily) behead the evil king (turns out magical swords yanked from bogs don\u2019t come pre-sharpened), he and his rag-tag group of quest companions are at a bit of a loss for what to do next. <br> <br>As a temporary safeguard, Arek\u2019s best friend and mage, Matt, convinces him to assume the throne until the true heir can be rescued from her tower. Except that she\u2019s dead. Now Arek is stuck as king, a role that comes with a magical catch: choose a spouse by your eighteenth birthday, or wither away into nothing.<br> <br>With his eighteenth birthday only three months away, and only Matt in on the secret, Arek embarks on a desperate bid to find a spouse to save his life\u2014starting with his quest companions. But his attempts at wooing his friends go painfully and hilariously wrong\u2026until he discovers that love might have been in front of him all along.",

Guided by her personal journey into social justice, brimming with humor, humanity, and joy, she urges all of us to ask ourselves, What will you do with your one life? </b><br><br> Only four years old when she kicked her first soccer ball, Megan Rapinoe developed a love \u2013 and clear talent \u2013 for the game at a young age. But it was her parents who taught her that winning was much less important than how she lived her life. From childhood on, Rapinoe always did what she could to stand up for what was right\u2014even if it meant going up against people who disagreed.<br><br> In\u00a0<i>One Life</i>, Megan Rapinoe invites readers on a remarkable journey, looking back on both her victories and her failures, and pulls back the curtain on events we know only from the headlines. After the 2011 World Cup, discouraged by how few athletes were open about their sexuality, Rapinoe decided to come out publicly as gay and use her platform to advocate for marriage equality. Recognizing the power she had to bring attention to critical issues, in 2016 she took a knee during the national anthem in solidarity with former NFL player Colin Kaepernick to protest racial injustice and police brutality\u2014the first high-profile white athlete to do so. The backlash was immediate, but it couldn\u2019t compare to the overwhelming support. Rapinoe became a force of change.\u00a0<br><br> Here for the first time, Rapinoe reflects upon some of the most pivotal moments in her life and career \u2013 from her realization in college that she was gay, through the disputes with soccer coaches and officials over her decision to kneel, to the first time she met her now-fianc\u00e9 WNBA champion Sue Bird, and up through suing the US Soccer Federation over gender discrimination and equal pay. Throughout, Rapinoe makes clear the obligation we all have to speak up, and the impact each of us can have on our communities. Deeply personal and inspiring,\u00a0<i>One Life\u00a0</i>reveals that real, concrete change lies within all of us, and asks: If we all have the same resource\u2014this one precious life, made up of the decisions we make every day\u2014what are you going to do?\u00a0<br> \u00a0<br> <b>\"<i>One Life</i>\u00a0makes it clear that Rapinoe\u2019s greatest accomplishments may ultimately come away from the soccer pitch. She\u2019s a new kind of American hero.\"\u2014<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>\u00a0</b>",

It would all be impossible if it weren't for her best friends, Thomas and Naoki. The three are also the only members of Jefferson High's Mystery Club, dedicated to exploring the weird and unexplained, from ESP and astrology to super powers and mysterious objects.<br><br>Then there's the Eye of Know, the possibly powerful crystal amulet Monty bought online. Will it help her predict the future or fight back against the ignorant jerks who make fun of Thomas for being gay or Monty for having lesbian moms? Maybe the Eye is here just in time, because the newest resident of their small town is scarier than mothmen, poltergeists, or, you know, gym.<br><br>Thoughtful, funny, and painfully honest, Montgomery Sole is someone you'll want to laugh and cry with over a big cup of frozen yogurt with extra toppings.</p>",

When within this striving \u201cBrotherhood of the Arts,\u201d two freshmen, David and Sarah, fall headlong into love, their passion does not go unnoticed\u2014or untoyed with\u2014by anyone, especially not by their charismatic acting teacher, Mr. Kingsley. <br><br>The outside world of family life and economic status, of academic pressure and of their future adult lives, fails to penetrate this school\u2019s walls\u2014until it does, in a shocking spiral of events that catapults the action forward in time and flips the premise upside-down. What the reader believes to have happened to David and Sarah and their friends is not entirely true\u2014though it\u2019s not false, either. It takes until the book\u2019s stunning coda for the final piece of the puzzle to fall into place\u2014revealing truths that will resonate long after the final sentence. <br><br>As captivating and tender as it is surprising, Susan Choi's <i>Trust Exercise</i> will incite heated conversations about fiction and truth, and about friendships and loyalties, and will leave readers with wiser understandings of the true capacities of adolescents and of the powers and responsibilities of adults.</p>",

Sponsored by their new art teacher, Ms. Stark, they band together to form the Daughters of Eve. It's more than a school club-it's a secret society, a sisterhood. At first, it seems like they are actually changing the way guys at school treat them. But Ms. Stark urges them to take more vindictive action, and it starts to feel more like revenge-<i>brutal </i>revenge. Blinded by their oath of loyalty, the Daughters of Eve become instruments of vengeance. Can one of them break the spell before real tragedy strikes?",

      "description": "When Mars Matthias loses his sister Caroline under horrific circumstances, it propels him to learn all he can about the once-inseparable sibling who'd grown tragically distant. Mars's gender-fluidity means he's often excluded from the traditions - and expectations - of his politically-connected family, including attendance at the prestigious Aspen Conservancy Summer Academy where his sister devoted so much of her time. But with his grief still fresh, he insists on attending in her place. The setting may be pristine and sun-drenched, but there's an undercurrent of tension buzzing ominously. Mars seeks out his sister's old friends: a group of girls dubbed the Honeys, named for the beehives they maintain behind their cabin. They are beautiful and terrifying - and Mars is certain they're connected to Caroline's death. But the longer he stays at Aspen, the more the sweet mountain breezes give way to hints of decay. Mars's memories begin to falter, bleached beneath the relentless summer sun. Something is hunting him in broad daylight, toying with his mind. If Mars can't find it soon, it will eat him alive...  <i>Heathers</i> meets <i>Midsommer</i>",

A young woman's mutilated body is found in a Los Angeles vacant lot. The story is seen through the eyes of Bucky Bleichert, ex-prize fighter and something of a boy wonder on the police force. There is no relief or humor as Bleichert arrives at a grisly discovery. Ellroy's powerful rendering of the long-reaching effects of murder gives the case new meaning.",

      "description": "<p>When <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i> was first published in English, it was hailed as \"a work of the boldest mastery, originality, and richness\" by critic Elizabeth Hardwick and named one of the best books of 1984 by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. It went on to win the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize for Fiction and quickly became an international bestseller. Twenty years later, the novel has established itself as a modern classic. To commemorate the anniversary of its first English-language publication, HarperCollins is proud to offer a special hardcover edition.</p> <p>A young woman in love with a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing; one of his mistresses and her humbly faithful lover -- these are the two couples whose story is told in this masterful novel.</p> <p>Controlled by day, Tereza's jealousy awakens by night, transformed into ineffably sad death-dreams, while Tomas, a successful surgeon, alternates loving devotion to the dependent Tereza with the ardent pursuit of other women. Sabina, an independent, free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayals -- of parents, husband, country, love itself -- whereas her lover, the intellectual Franz, loses all because of his earnest goodness and fidelity.</p> <p>In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel, says the novelist, \"the unbearable lightness of being\" -- not only as the consequence of our private acts but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine.</p> <p>This magnificent novel encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, and embraces, it seems, all aspects of human existence. It juxtaposes geographically distant places (Prague, Geneva, Paris, Thailand, the United States, a forlorn Bohemian village); brilliant and playful reflections (on \"eternal return,\" on kitsch, on man and animals -- Tomas and Tereza have a beloved doe named Karenin); and a variety of styles (from the farcical to the elegiac) to take its place as perhaps the major achievement of one of the world's truly great writers.</p>",

I\u2019ve returned to Katmere Academy, but I\u2019m haunted by fragments of days I have no recollection of living and struggling to understand who, or what, I really am. <br><br>Just when I start to feel safe again, Hudson is back with a vengeance. He insists there are secrets I don\u2019t know about, threatening to drive a wedge between Jaxon and me forever. But far worse enemies are at our doorstep. <br><br>The Circle is caught in a power play, and the Vampire Court is trying to drag me out of my world and into theirs. The only thing Hudson and Jaxon agree on is that leaving Katmere would mean my certain death. <br><br>And not only am I fighting for my life, but now everyone else\u2019s is at stake\u2014unless we can defeat an unspeakable evil. All I know is that saving the people I love is going to require sacrifice. <br><br>Maybe more than I\u2019m able to give. <br><br><i>Don\u2019t miss a single book in the series that spawned a phenomenon!

While the experts cite statistics and employ rhetoric about drug abuse, crime, and child abuse, individuals confront the horrors of addiction and the trauma of victimization. Greenhaven Press's Social Issues Firsthand series illuminates the often-neglected human side of society's pressing problems. Each anthology presents a collection of personal narratives on a featured social issue. Contributors inclue those who have had personal experience with the topic under discussion-either as a participant, a witness, or an involved professional. For example, Terrorism includes the perspectives of terrorists, victims, families of victims, and emergency workers. Additional features include an introduction that provides each book with essential context, a thorough bibliography, a list of organizations to contact, an annotated table of contents, and a thorough index. Each book in the Social Issues Firsthand series will provide readers with a personal context for the most pressing topics of today's political discussions. Book jacket.",

An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him.<br><br> <i>Of Mice and Men </i>represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as \u201ca kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.\u201d A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. This edition features an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, one of today\u2019s leading Steinbeck scholars.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.<br><br><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

On top of that, weird happenings including an impossible tornado and an all-consuming fog are cropping up around them\u2014maybe even because of them. And as the two grow closer and confront bigger truths about their pasts, they must also deal with such inconveniences as a narcissistic rock star, a war between unicorns and dragons, and eventually, of course, the apocalypse. <br> <br>With a unique mix of raw emotion, humor, and heart, the surreal plotline pulls readers through an epic exploration of how caring for others makes us vulnerable\u2014and how utterly pointless life would be if we didn\u2019t.",

Each short story uses hair routines as a window into these four characters' everyday lives and how they care for each other.<br><br>Jamila Rowser and Robyn Smith originally kickstarted their critically acclaimed, award-winning slice of life mini comic, <i>Wash Day</i>, inspired by Rowser's own wash day ritual and their shared desire to see more comics featuring the daily lived experiences of young Black women. <i>Wash Day Diaries</i> includes an updated, full color version of this original comic\u2014which follows Kim, a 26-year-old woman living in the Bronx\u2014as the book's first chapter and expands into a graphic novel with short stories about these vibrant and relatable new characters.<br><br>In expanding the story of Kim and her friends, the authors pay tribute to Black sisterhood through portraits of shared, yet deeply personal experiences of Black hair care. From self-care to spilling the tea at an hours-long salon appointment to healing family rifts, the stories are brought to life through beautifully drawn characters and different color palettes reflecting the mood in each story.<br><br>At times touching, quiet, triumphant, and laugh out loud funny, the stories of <i>Wash Day Diaries</i> pay a loving tribute to Black joy and the resilience of Black women.",

It's not that I didn't <i>want</i> to fall in love again, since that's about the best feeling ever. But as a busy college premed still raw from heartbreak, which is the <i>worst</i> feeling ever, I figured I'd lie low for a while. Of course, as soon as I stopped looking for someone, an impossibly amazing--and devastatingly cute--guy came along, and I learned that having a new boyfriend is the quickest way to recover from losing your old one.<br> The moment we got together, all my preconceptions about romance and sex were turned upside down. I discovered physical and emotional firsts I never knew existed. I learned to let go of my past by living in the present. It was thrilling. It was <i>hot</i>. It was just what the doctor ordered.<br> But I couldn't avoid my future forever.<br> In Daria Snadowsky's daring sequel to <i>Anatomy of a Boyfriend</i>, eighteen-year-old Dominique explores the relationship between love and lust, and the friendships that see us through.<br> <br> <b>\"Dominique is a strong female character who makes informed decisions and demonstrates control over her own body and goals. . . . This book could be popular with girls who are curious and interested in reading about intimate young adult relationships.\"--<i>VOYA</i></b><br> <br> <b>\"Presents a multiplicity of opinions and stories about sex, intimacy and relationships and lets readers come to their own conclusions.\"--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p>",

      "description": "<b>In this joyful and impactful picture book, a transgender boy prepares for the first day of school and introduces himself to his family and friends for the first time.</b><br><br>Calvin has always been a boy, even if the world sees him as a girl. He knows who he is in his heart and in his mind but he hasn't yet told his family. Finally, he can wait no longer: \"I'm not a girl,\" he tells his family. \"I'm a boy--a boy in my heart and in my brain.\" Quick to support him, his loving family takes Calvin shopping for the swim trunks he's always wanted and back-to-school clothes and a new haircut that helps him look and feel like the boy he's always known himself to be. As the first day of school approaches, he's nervous and the \"what-ifs\" gather up inside him. But as his friends and teachers rally around him and he tells them his name, all his \"what-ifs\" begin to melt away.<br><br>Inspired by the authors' own transgender child and accompanied by warm and triumphant illustrations, this authentic and personal text promotes kindness and empathy, offering a poignant and inclusive back-to-school message: all should feel safe, respected, and welcomed.",

The islanders return this gift with a monument of four boulders in their honor, which the Mahu imbue with healing powers before disappearing.<br><br>As time passes, foreigners inhabit the island and the once-sacred stones are forgotten until the 1960s. Though the true story of these stones was not fully recovered, the power of the Mahu still calls out to those who pass by them at Waikiki Beach today. <br><br>With illuminating words and stunning illustrations by Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, Dean Hamer, Joe Wilson, and Daniel Sousa, KAPAEMAHU is a monument to an Indigenous Hawaiian legend and a classic in the making.",

Amid a rich community of unforgettable island women and the exotic beauty of marshlands, tidal creeks, and majestic egrets, Jessie grapples with the tension of desire and the struggle to deny it, with a freedom that feels overwhelmingly right, and with the immutable force of home and marriage.<br><br> Is the power of the mermaid chair only a myth? Or will it alter the course of Jessie\u2019s life? What happens will unlock the roots of her mother\u2019s tormented past, but most of all, it will allow Jessie to discover selfhood and a place of belonging as she explores the thin line between the spiritual and the erotic.",

      "description": "A wedding. A trip to Spain. The most infuriating man. And three days of pretending. Or in other words, a plan that will never work. Catalina Marti \u0301n, finally, not single. Her family is happy to announce that she will bring her American boyfriend to her sister's wedding. Everyone is invited to come and witness the most magical event of the year. That would certainly be tomorrow's headline in the local newspaper of the small Spanish town I came from. Or the epitaph on my tombstone, seeing the turn my life had taken in the span of a phone call. Four weeks wasn't a lot of time to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic-from NYC and all the way to Spain-for a wedding. Let alone, someone eager to play along with my charade. But that didn't mean I was desperate enough to bring the 6'4 blue eyed pain in my ass standing before me, Aaron Blackford. The man whose main occupation was making my blood boil had just offered himself to be my date. Right after inserting his nose in my business, calling me delusional, and calling himself my best option. See? Outrageous. Aggravating. Blood boiling. And much to my total despair, also right. Which left me with a surly and extra large dilemma in my hands. Was it worth the suffering to bring my colleague and bane of my existence as my fake boyfriend to my sister's wedding? Or was I better off coming clean and facing the consequences of my panic induced lie? Like my abuela would say, que dios nos pille confesados.",

      "description": "<b>Salem, Massachusetts, 1692.</b> <p> In a plain meetinghouse, a woman stands before her judges. The accusers, girls and young women, are fervent, overexcited, just on the edge of breaking out into convulsions. The accused is a poor, unpopular woman who had her first child before she was married. As the trial proceeds, the girls begin to wail, tear their clothing, and scream that the woman is hurting them. Some of them expose wounds to the horrified onlookers, holding out the pins that have stabbed them -- pins that have appeared as if by magic. Are the girls acting, or are they really tormented by an unseen evil? Whatever the cause, the nightmare in Salem has begun: The witch trials will eventually claim twenty-five lives, shatter the community, and forever shape the American social conscience. <p> Acclaimed historian Marc Aronson sifts through the facts, myths, half-truths, misinterpretations, and theories around the Salem witch trials to present us with a vivid narrative of one of the most compelling mysteries in American history. <i>Witch-Hunt</i> is a brilliant book that will stimulate and challenge readers to come to their own conclusions about what really happened during those terrifying months of accusations, trials, and executions.",

Time falls away as she is swept into a mythical journey far beyond mortal comprehension, where she must finally make the decision she has been avoiding for almost a millennium.\u00a0 <br>\u00a0<br>Bram Stoker\u2019s classic novel offered one side of the story, in which Mina had no past and bore no responsibility for the unfolding events. Now, for the first time, the truth of Mina\u2019s personal voyage, and of vampirism itself, is revealed. What this flesh and blood woman has to say is more sensual, more devious, and more enthralling than the Victorians could have expressed or perhaps even have imagined.",

She's been shot at, spat at, cussed at, fire-bombed, mooned, and attacked by dogs. Time for a change, Stephanie thinks. Time to find the kind of job her mother can tell her friends about without making the sign of the cross. <br><br>So Stephanie Plum quits. Resigns. No looking back. No changing her mind. She wants something safe and normal. As it turns out, jobs that are safe and normal for most people aren't necessarily safe and normal for Stephanie Plum. Trouble follows her, and the kind of trouble she had at the bail bonds office can't compare to the kind of trouble she finds herself facing now. Her past has come back to haunt her. She's stalked by a maniac returned from the grave for the sole purpose of putting her into a burial plot of her own. He's killed before, and he'll kill again if given the chance. Caught between staying far away from the bounty hunter business and staying alive, Stephanie reexamines her life and the possibility that being a bounty hunter is the solution rather than the problem. After disturbingly brief careers at the button factory, Kan Klean Dry Cleaners, and Cluck-in-a-Bucket, Stephanie takes an office position in security, working for Ranger, the sexiest, baddest bounty hunter and businessman on two continents. It might not be the job she'll keep for the rest of her life, but for now it gives her the technical access she needs to find her stalker. Tempers and temperatures rise as competition ratchets up between the two men in her life---her on-again, off-again boyfriend, tough Trenton cop Joe Morelli, and her bad-ass boss, Ranger. Can Stephanie Plum take the heat? Can you?<br><br>Between the adventure and the adversity there's attitude, and Stephanie Plum's got plenty in her newest misadventure from Janet Evanovich, <i>Eleven on Top</i>.</p>",

Leave it to the maverick of the family to get Barney involved with high-speed car chases, a search for sunken treasure, and Sam Hooker, a NASCAR driver who\u2019s good at revving a woman's engine. </p> <p> Engaged in a deadly race, Bill has \"borrowed\" Hooker's sixty-five-foot Hatteras and sailed off into the sunset...just when Hooker has plans for the boat. Hooker figures he'll attach himself to Barney and maybe run into scumbag Bill. And better yet, maybe he'll get lucky in love with Bill's sweetie pie sister. </p> <p> The pedal will have to go to metal if Barney and Hooker want to be the first to cross the finish line, save Bill, Hooker's boat...and maybe the world. </p>",

      "description": "<p>Looking to get lucky?<br><br>Stephanie Plum is back between-the-numbers and she's looking to get lucky in an Atlantic City hotel room, in a Winnebago, and with a brown-eyed stud who has stolen her heart.<br><br>Stephanie Plum has a way of attracting danger, lunatics, oddballs, bad luck . . . and mystery men. And no one is more mysterious than the unmentionable Diesel. He's back and hot on the trail of a little man in green pants who's lost a giant bag of money. Problem is, the money isn't exactly lost. Stephanie's Grandma Mazur has found it, and like any good Jersey senior citizen, she's hightailed it in a Winnebago to Atlantic City and hit the slots. With Lula and Connie in tow, Stephanie attempts to bring Grandma home, but the luck of the Irish is rubbing off on everyone: Lula's found a job modeling plus-size lingerie. Connie's found a guy. Diesel's found Stephanie. And Stephanie has found herself in over her head with a caper involving thrice-stolen money, a racehorse, a car chase, and a bad case of hives. <br><br><i>Plum Lucky</i> is an all-you-can-eat buffet of thrills, chills, shrimp cocktail, plus-size underwear, and scorching hot men. It's a between-the-numbers treat no Evanovich fan will want to miss!</p>",

      "description": "The First Full Length Stephanie Plum Between-the-Numbers Novel from #1 Bestselling Author Janet Evanovich.<br>Turn on all the lights and check under your bed. Things are about to get spooky in Trenton, New Jersey. According to legend, the Jersey Devil prowls the Pine Barrens and soars above the treetops in the dark of night. As eerie as this might seem, there are things in the Barrens that are even more frightening and dangerous. And there are monkeys. Lots of monkeys. Wulf Grimoire is a world wanderer and an opportunist who can kill without remorse and disappear like smoke. He\u2019s chosen Martin Munch, boy genius, as his new business partner, and he\u2019s chosen the Barrens as his new playground. Munch received his doctorate degree in quantum physics when he was twenty-two. He\u2019s now twenty-four, and while his brain is large, his body hasn\u2019t made it out of the boys\u2019 department at Macy\u2019s. Anyone who says good things come in small packages hasn\u2019t met Munch. Wulf Grimoire is looking for world domination. Martin Munch would be happy if he could just get a woman naked and tied to a tree. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has Munch on her most-wanted list for failure to appear in court. Plum is the all-American girl stuck in an uncomfortable job, succeeding on luck and tenacity. Usually she gets her man. This time she gets a monkey. She also gets a big guy named Diesel. Diesel pops in and out of Plum\u2019s life like birthday cake \u2013 delicious to look at and taste, not especially healthy as a steady diet, gone by the end of the week if not sooner. He\u2019s an \u00fcber bounty hunter with special skills when it comes to tracking men and pleasing women. He\u2019s after Grimoire, and now he\u2019s also after Munch. And if truth were told, he wouldn\u2019t mind setting Stephanie Plum in his crosshairs. Diesel and Plum hunt down Munch and Grimoire, following them into the Barrens, surviving cranberry bogs, the Jersey Devil, a hair-raising experience, sand in their underwear, and, of course . . . monkeys.<br>",

Lorelei King once again displays her impeccable versatility as she portrays a dozen characters, not only sexy, savvy 30-year-old Plum, but also Plum's two loves--mysterious Ranger and tough Vice cop Joe Morelli--as well as the terrified kidnapped child. Even though the book has a tense, dark plot, King shines in its comic moments, which feature Plum's sassy, unpredictable partner, Lula, as well as her swinger Grandma, impatient mother, and grumpy father. In a big audiobook bonus, King interviews the author on life, love, work habits, and Plum's muddled relationships with men. M.T.B. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.",

      "description": "<b>From #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Dirty Thirty </i>and \u201cmost popular mystery writer alive\u201d (<i>The New York Times</i>), Janet Evanovich\u2019s <i>Two for the Dough</i> is irresistibly fun and powerful suspense entertainment featuring beloved bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. </b><br><br>It's the return of Stephanie Plum, New Jersey\u2019s \u201cfugitive apprehension\u201d agent (a.k.a. bounty hunter), introduced to us in the award-winning and bestselling novel <i>One for the Money.</i><br> <br> Now Stephanie's back, armed with attitude\u2014not to mention stun guns, defense sprays, killer flashlights, and her trusty .38, Stephanie is after a new bail jumper, Kenny Mancuso, a boy from Trenton\u2019s burg. He\u2019s fresh out of the army, suspiciously wealthy, and he\u2019s just shot his best friend.<br> <br> With her bounty hunter pal Ranger stepping in occasionally to advise her, Stephanie staggers knee-deep in corpses and caskets as she traipses through back streets, dark alleys, and funeral parlors.<br> <br> And nobody knows funeral parlors better than Stephanie's irrepressible Grandma Mazur, a lady whose favorite pastime is grabbing a front-row seat at a neighborhood wake. So, Stephanie uses Grandma as a cover to follow leads, but loses control when Grandma warms to the action, packing a cool pistol. Much to the family\u2019s chagrin, Stephanie and Granny may soon have the elusive Kenny in their sights.<br> <br> Fast-talking, slow-handed vice cop Joe Morelli joins in the case, since the prey happens to be his young cousin. And if the assignment calls for an automobile stakeout for two with the woman who puts his libido in overdrive, Morelli\u2019s not one to object.<br> <br> Low on expertise but learning fast, high on resilience, and despite the help she gets from friends and relatives, Stephanie eventually must face the danger alone when embalmed body parts begin to arrive on her doorstep and she\u2019s targeted for a nasty death by the most loathsome adversary she's ever encountered. Another case like this and she'll be a real pro.",

So of course she follows him to Texas when he leaves for college. She just didn't expect to be so drawn to their new roommate, Gage, a gorgeous guy with a husky Southern drawl. The only problem? He's Tyler's cousin.</p><p>Gage Carson was excited to share an apartment off campus with his cousin. He didn't mind that Tyler was bringing the mysterious friend he'd heard about since they were kids . . . until the most beautiful girl he's ever seen jumps out of his cousin's Jeep.

Too bad Tyler has warned him that she's strictly off-limits.</p><p>Despite everything keeping them apart, Cassi and Gage dance dangerously close to the touch they've both been craving. But when disaster sends her running into Tyler's arms, Cassi will have to decide whether to face the demons of herpast . . . or to burn her chance at a future with Gage.</p>",

Low-level teen fiction tackling tough and gritty topics like foster care, rape, teen pregnancy and more. Series contains a silver medal winner for the Independent Publishers Book Award. Each eBook is approximately 200-pages. Lexile Levels: 390 to 400. Sixteen-year-old Neema Powell was always the best-looking girl in school. Her girlfriends said that she looked like Beyonce, with beautiful caramel skin and a body others would kill for. But right now she was a wreck. Her mother's sleazy boyfriend was towering over her screaming, &quot;Get out!&quot; And her own mother wouldn't even look at her as she walked out of the apartment into the dead January day. Neema knew that Nate, her boyfriend, would take care of her. I'll give Mom a couple of days to calm down, Neema thought, and I'll swing by to pick up a few items. Like my pills. A couple of days couldn't hurt. But those two days made all the difference, and Neema must draw from somewhere deep for the inner strength she will need.",

Or is that a blend of Chanel no. 9 and Gucci Rush? Is there a difference?<br><br> Blair moves in with Serena and they're back to being best friends. Will the love-fest last, or will they end up tearing out one another's newly highlighted hair? And speaking of new, Nate is on the straight and narrow, playing Nate-in-shining-armor to his crazy new girlfriend, Georgie. But he will definitely get more than he bargained for when he, Georgie, Blair, and Serena end up hanging out together in Sun Valley, Idaho. Back in Manhattan, Jenny is spending time with a mysteriously nice new boyfriend and Dan is spending time crying in the office of the <i>Red Letter</i> literary journal. And Vanessa--wait, is that Vanessa shopping at Barneys with a guy in a Lacoste shirt? <br><br> The long cold winter is over and the sun is finally shining along Fifth Avenue. The trees are in bloom and NYC's most fabulous are ready for a truly outrageous vacation!",

New BFFs Jenny Humphrey and Tinsley Carmichael are determined to snap their glum but still uberstylish roomie Callie Vernon out of her funk-it's been weeks since her boyfriend Easy Walsh was kicked out of school, and they're sick of her moping. The plan: head to NYC for some R & R! And some SS (serious shopping).<br><br>But the girls quickly discover that a quiet holiday is not in store for them. A cozy Thanksgiving dinner turns into a three-day party with a few of their classmates-and some irresistible mystery guests. Jenny meets Mr. Right but is determined not to fall in love for the fourth time this fall. Tinsley has her own holiday mission: to win back adorable freshman Julian McCafferty. And Callie is holding out for Easy . . . which is hard to do with a cute college boy following her around. Brett Messerschmidt is missing in action-forced to spend Thanksgiving in her family's tacky Jersey McMansion. But drama's on the menu at the dinner table. And maybe love too.<br><br>Forget turkey and stuffing. When you're an It Girl, a holiday is just another<br>excuse to break out the bubbly.",

Meanwhile, Dan is to busy drowning his sorrows in empty bottles to notice a mysterious French beauty who has a penchant for dirty, Jim Morrison-wannabe lead singers. Blair takes residence at the Plaza to think about her future. Will she become a gun-toting international spy or Manhattan's snobbiest society hostess? Decisions are so difficult! Sounds like everyone needs a day off at the spa. And Senior Spa Day promises to serve up further doses of scandal for New York's busiest private-school vixens.",

And it's finally, finally happening! She's even rooming with the two most popular girls in school, Callie Vernon and Brett Messerschmidt, and bunking in the notorious Tinsley Carmichael's old bed. Coolness is rubbing off on her, even while she sleeps! <br><br>Okay, so Callie almost got Jenny kicked out of Waverly on her first night there, but there's a bright side. Like Callie's shaggy-haired boyfriend, Easy Walsh, who just can't seem to focus on his girlfriend anymore. Now everyone is gossiping about boyfriend-stealing Jenny. They can't help but whisper: Jenny's it. <br><br>But who's that flying in on her seaplane? After getting expelled last year, Tinsley's back and she's not about to let some big-chested, rosy-cheeked city-girl get all the attention. And she's certainly not going to let Callie and Brett forget that she took the fall for them. Now it's their turn. <br><br>Is Waverly big enough for Jenny, Callie, Brett, and Tinsley? They're all beautiful, captivating, and a little bit crazy . . . but there can be only one It Girl.",

She quickly caught the eye of three of the hottest guys on campus, kissed two of them, and made one her boyfriend: the adorable Easy Walsh. Too bad Easy just happened to belong to somebody else - Jenny's roommate, Callie Vernon. <br><br>It didn't take long for powerful Tinsley Carmichael to tell Callie their sweet-faced new roommate was really a manipulative skank. So what if Tinsley herself stole a guy out from under their other roommate Brett Messerschmidt's perky little nose? Then Callie and Tinsley threw Jenny and Brett out of their ultra-exclusive club. And just like that, it was war. <br><br>Now the four roommates have been split up across enemy lines - Jenny and Callie are living together in Dumbarton 303, and Brett and Tinsley are seemingly miles away downstairs. What will happen when Easy sneaks in to see Jenny . . . but finds Callie instead? And what if Brett discovers the one secret Tinsley's kept hidden for years? <br><br>Everyone at Waverly is watching and whispering. With girls this wild, anything can happen, but only one can be it.",

But Callie Vernon never really liked late-night girl talk or swapping cashmere sweaters with her younger, rosy-cheeked roomie, Jenny Humphrey. So when Jenny stole her longtime boyfriend, Easy Walsh, Callie didn't feel that guilty about turning right around and kissing him behind Jenny's back. Okay, maybe a little guilty, but it certainly didn't stop her from enjoying it. Now, if only Easy would stop being so irritatingly indecisive and dump Jenny already!<br><br>While the two roommates are sharing a boyfriend, the rest of Dumbarton's residents are sharing their feelings at the newly founded Women of Waverly club--aka, WOW! Everyone is totally bonding, revealing their most personal secrets, and hugging out their past rivalries. But despite the sharing-is-caring vibe, there are some things these girls aren't spilling--like who's making special late-night trips to the crater . . . and with whom.<br><br>Now it's only a matter of time before all the newfound girl power explodes into a massive girl fight. But this battle goes well beyond the ivy colored brick walls of Dumberton--it's about who will be Waverly's next It Girl. <br>",

Also new to this collection is \"The Book of Martha\" which asks: What would you do if God granted you the ability\u2014and responsibility\u2014to save humanity from itself?<br>Like all of Octavia Butler\u2019s best writing, these works of the imagination are parables of the contemporary world. She proves constant in her vigil, an unblinking pessimist hoping to be proven wrong, and one of contemporary literature\u2019s strongest voices.",

Just as she was willing to overlook his gambling habits, she discovers his secret meetings with Sophia, his gorgeous ex-girlfriend and his son Eli\u2019s occasional girlfriend. Life gets even more complicated when Tara\u2019s niece, Kayla, starts hooking up with Eli. In a matter of weeks, Tara has reluctantly gone from rich, single San Francisco professional to Lake Tahoe housewife managing her niece\u2019s whiplash moods, while resisting her stepson\u2019s tantalizing sexual advances.<br> <br>Adding to the family drama is her younger sister, Melody, who\u2019s having a serious marital breakdown, which means she might know something about her husband Graham and Tara\u2019s brief dalliance years ago. As Tara\u2019s fragile trust in her family teeters, timed with the arrival of certain people from her past, she also can\u2019t shake the feeling that someone\u2019s watching her. Baiting her.<br> <br>Tara has always considered herself a tough, self-made woman after surviving a childhood defined by poverty, abuse, and neglect. For years, she suffered from the sins of others. She committed a few of her own. Now she wonders if the misdeeds of her past are about to catch up with her\u2014and if she can ever outrun them.",

But after one horrible night in Afghanistan scars him in a way that he can't get past, he needs someone who can help him heal, even if he doesn't realise it. 25 year-old Madison Hill doesn't need anybody - or so she thinks. She grew up watching her parents' messed-up, abusive relationship and she knows there's no way in hell that she's ever letting that happen to her. They don't know it in the beginning, but Gabriel and Madison will soon develop a weakness. Each other.",

Tagging along is his diminutive squire, a boy called Egg\u2014whose true name is hidden from all he and Dunk encounter.

Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack the innocent. He roams the country seeking assignments, but gradually comes to realise that while some of his quarry are unremittingly vile, vicious grotesques, others are the victims of sin, evil or simple naivety. </p><p>One reviewer said: 'This book is a sheer delight. It is beautifully written, full of vitality and endlessly inventive: its format, with half a dozen episodes and intervening rest periods for both the hero and the reader, allows for a huge range of characters, scenarios and action. It's thought-provoking without being in the least dogmatic, witty without descending to farce and packed with sword fights without being derivative. The dialogue sparkles; characters morph almost imperceptibly from semi-cliche to completely original; nothing is as it first seems. Sapkowski succeeds in seamlessly welding familiar ideas, unique settings and delicious twists of originality: his Beauty wants to rip the throat out of a sensitive Beast; his Snow White seeks vengeance on all and sundry, his elves are embittered and vindictive. It's easily one of the best things I've read in ages.'</p>",

When she stumbles upon the dead body of thirteen-year-old Ashley James, Georgia teams up with Ashley's older sister Nora, to find the killer before he strikes again, and their investigation throws Georgia into a glittering world of unimaginable privilege and wealth--and all she's ever dreamed. But behind every dream lurks a nightmare, and Georgia must reconcile her heart's desires with what it really takes to survive. As Ashley's killer closes in and their feelings for one another grow, Georgia and Nora will discover when money, power, and beauty rule, it's not always a matter of who is guilty but who is guiltiest--and the only thing that might save them is each other.<br><br><i>I\u2019m the Girl</i> is a brutal and illuminating account of how one young woman feels in her body as she struggles to navigate a deadly and predatory power structure while asking readers one question: if this is the way the world is, do you accept it?</p>",

I don't leave my house, have not left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla. <br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He's tall, lean and wearing all black--black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change--starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer. <br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe we can't predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It's almost certainly going to be a disaster.",

      "description": "<b>Named one of the Best Nonfiction Books of 2019 by <i>School Library Journal</i></b><br><br><b>Queer history didn\u2019t start with Stonewall. This book explores how LGBTQ people have always been a part of our national identity, contributing to the country and culture for over 400 years.</b><br><br>It is crucial for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth to know their history. But this history is not easy to find since it\u2019s rarely taught in schools or commemorated in other ways. <i>A Queer History of the United States for Young People</i> corrects this and demonstrates that LGBTQ people have long been vital to shaping our understanding of what America is today.<br><br>Through engrossing narratives, letters, drawings, poems, and more, the book encourages young readers, of all identities, to feel pride at the accomplishments of the LGBTQ people who came before them and to use history as a guide to the future. The stories he shares include those of<br><br>* Indigenous tribes who embraced same-sex relationships and a multiplicity of gender identities.<br>* Emily Dickinson, brilliant nineteenth-century poet who wrote about her desire for women.<br>* Gladys Bentley, Harlem blues singer who challenged restrictive cross-dressing laws in the 1920s.<br>* Bayard Rustin, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s close friend, civil rights organizer, and an openly gay man.<br>* Sylvia Rivera, cofounder of STAR, the first transgender activist group in the US in 1970.<br>* Kiyoshi Kuromiya, civil rights and antiwar activist who fought for people living with AIDS.<br>* Jamie Nabozny, activist who took his LGBTQ school bullying case to the Supreme Court.<br>* Aidan DeStefano, teen who brought a federal court case for trans-inclusive bathroom policies.<br>* And many more! <br><br>With over 60 illustrations and photos, a glossary, and a corresponding curriculum, <i>A Queer History of the United States for Young People</i> will be vital for teachers who want to introduce a new perspective to America\u2019s story.",

It meant living a closeted life or surviving on the fringes of society. People went to jail, lost jobs, and were disowned by their families for being gay. Most doctors considered homosexuality a mental illness. There were few safe havens. The Stonewall Inn, a Mafia-run, filthy, overpriced bar in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village, was one of them.<br><br> Police raids on gay bars happened regularly in this era. But one hot June night, when cops pounded on the door of the Stonewall, almost nothing went as planned. Tensions were high. The crowd refused to go away. Anger and frustration boiled over.<br><br> The raid became a riot.<br><br> The riot became a catalyst.<br><br> The catalyst triggered an explosive demand for gay rights.<br><br> A riveting exploration of the Stonewall Riots and the national Gay Rights movement that followed is eye-opening, unflinching, and inspiring.",

Perfect for fans of Adam Silvera, Alex London, and Heartstopper by Alice Oseman.</p><p>When Andrew stumbles upon Jamie\u2019s house, he\u2019s injured, starved, and has nothing left to lose. A deadly pathogen has killed off most of the world\u2019s population, including everyone both boys have ever loved. And if this new world has taught them anything, it\u2019s to be scared of what other desperate people will do . . . so why does it seem so easy for them to trust each other?</p><p>After danger breaches their shelter, they flee south in search of civilization. But something isn\u2019t adding up about Andrew\u2019s story, and it could cost them everything. And Jamie has a secret, too. He\u2019s starting to feel something more than friendship for Andrew, adding another layer of fear and confusion to an already tumultuous journey.</p><p>The road ahead of them is long, and to survive, they\u2019ll have to shed their secrets, face the consequences of their actions, and find the courage to fight for the future they desire, together. Only one thing feels certain: all that\u2019s left in their world is the undeniable pull they have toward each other.</p>",

He romps around his house naked and wild and free. Until he romps into his parents' closet and is inspired to get dressed. First he tries on his dad's clothes, but they don't fit well. Then he tries on his mom's clothes, and wow! The boy looks great. He looks through his mom's jewelry and makeup and tries that on, too. When he's discovered by his mother and father, the whole family (including the dog!) get in on the fun, and they all get dressed together.<br><br>This charming and humorous story was inspired by bestselling and award-winning author Peter Brown's own childhood, and highlights nontraditional gender roles and self-expression.",

Perhaps the greatest dancer of the twentieth century, Nijinsky captured audiences with his sheer animal magnetism and incredible skill. <br><br>He was also half of the most famous (and openly gay) couple of the Edwardian era: his relationship with Serge Diaghilev, artistic director and architect of the Ballets Russes, pushed boundaries in a time when homosexuality and bisexuality were rarely discussed. Nijinsky's life was tumultuous--after marrying a female groupie he hardly knew, he was kicked out of the Ballets Russes and placed under house arrest during World War I. Unable to work as he once did, his mental health deteriorated, and he spent three decades in and out of institutions.<br><br>Biographical narrative is interspersed with spotlights on the ballets the dancer popularized: classic masterworks such as <i>Afternoon of a Faun</i>, <i>The Firebird</i>, and of course, the shockingly original <i>Rite of Spring</i>, which caused the audience to riot at its premiere. Illustrated with elegant, intimate portraits as well as archival art and photographs.",

Now Henna is determined to find a legendary, long-extinct plant with miraculous healing powers, even though the search means journeying all the way to St. Basil\u2019s Conservatory, a botanical boarding school rumored to house seeds of every plant ever grown. At St. Basil\u2019s, Henna is surrounded not only by incredible plants, but also, for the first time, other kids\u2014including her new roommates: wisecracking, genderfluid P, who gleefully bends every rule they come up against, and wealthy, distant Lora, who is tired of servants doing everything for her, from folding her clothes to pushing her wheelchair. But Henna\u2019s search for the fabled healing seed means she doesn\u2019t have time for friends\u2014or so she thinks. This tender tale, blossoming with moments of joy, is a story of hope, grief, and learning to flourish with a little help from those around you.</p>",

So they carry on in secret until Nasrin\u2019s parents suddenly announce that they\u2019ve arranged for her marriage. Then Sahar discovers what seems like the perfect solution: homosexuality may be a crime, but to be a man trapped in a woman\u2019s body is seen as nature\u2019s mistake, and sex reassignment is legal and accessible. Sahar will never be able to love Nasrin in the body she wants to be loved in without risking their lives, but is saving their love worth sacrificing her true self?<br><br> \u00a0",

Her older brother Thad is preoccupied with his girlfriend of the moment and doesn't seem to like the family anymore. No, Sophie likes being who she is right now, helping out at home, doing art projects, and hanging out with her two best friends. <br> And another thing. Next year Sophie's class will see <i>the movie</i> about body changes, and her classmates are already buzzing about it. Sophie doesn't want to know about that embarrassing stuff yet. Does that mean she's immature? How can she prove otherwise? <br> As usual, Sophie faces challenges and challengers with determination and resourcefulness. With the same down-to-earth, realistic, humorous take on friendships and family relationships praised in the three previous Sophie Hartley books, this fourth story brings the indomitable Sophie a step closer to growing up without compromising her sense of herself.</p>",

Dragons burn the city's garbage, taxi its busy citizens from place to place, and even compete in vicious underground battles for ganglike kins.</p><p>But the dragons also compete in <i>legal</i> sports, like the spectacular aerial races that draw in cheering crowds by the tens of thousands.</p><p>Abel is at just such a race when he witnesses the unthinkable. A long-shot competitor pulls off an impossible win -- then flies into a destructive rage! Someone in the city is experimenting on dragons: hacking their DNA, rebuilding their bodies, and breaking their minds. Who could be driving the dragons berserk?</p><p>Abel <i>must</i> find out who's behind the experiments and put a stop to them, and to do so he\u2019ll infiltrate the kins\u2019 underground street races on a long-shot dragon of his own. But with his sister working for a kin, his brother serving the city's secret police, and a bully at school racing for Abel's worst enemies, will Abel find any safety past the finish line?</p>",

Her mother shunned her, and her pastor asked God to kill her. But then Parks's grandmother, a stern conservative who grew up picking cotton, pulled her aside and revealed a startling secret. \"I grew up across the street from a woman who lived as a man,\" and then implored Casey to find out what happened to him. <i>Diary of a Misfit</i> is the story of Parks's life-changing journey to unravel the mystery of Roy Hudgins, the small-town country singer from grandmother\u2019s youth, all the while confronting ghosts of her own.<br><br>For ten years, Parks traveled back to rural Louisiana and knocked on strangers\u2019 doors, dug through nursing home records, and doggedly searched for Roy\u2019s own diaries, trying to uncover what Roy was like as a person\u2014what he felt; what he thought; and how he grappled with his sense of otherness. With an enormous heart and an unstinting sense of vulnerability, Parks writes about finding oneself through someone else\u2019s story, and about forging connections across the gulfs that divide us.",

The articles collected here detail the evolution of the debate, from individual cases that captured national attention to the implementation of California's Affirmative Consent law. Beyond highlighting the legal and administrative responses to these cases, this book also features stories of the consequences students have faced in their daily lives as they navigate the debate.",

He's out, he's proud ... and, although he doesn't know it yet, he's about to travel back in time to save a closeted student called Chaz from a tragic end.</b><br><br>All Luis Gonzalez really wants is to go to prom with his boyfriend.

At the heart of this astonishing novel is Ruth Anne Boatwright, known simply as Bone, a South Carolina bastard with an annotated birth certificate to tell the tale. Observing everything with the mercilessly keen eye of a child, Bone finds herself caught in a family triangle that will test the loyalty of her mother, Anney. Her stepfather, Daddy Glen, calls Bone &quot;cold as death, mean as a snake, and twice as twisty,&quot; yet Anney needs Glen. At first gentle with Bone, Daddy Glen becomes steadily colder and more furious\u2014until their final, harrowing encounter, from which there can be no turning back.",

Bravo to this extraordinary new voice.\"--Mary Karr For as long as they can remember, Cyrus Grace Dunham felt like a visitor in their own body. Their life was a series of imitations-lovable little girl, daughter, sister, young gay woman-until their profound sense of alienation became intolerable. This is the story of their search for a new name. Rather than looking back on gender transition from a settled distance, Cyrus invites us into the process as it unfolds, honoring the messiness, confusion, self-doubt, terror, and thrill of self-discovery. Signaling the arrival of a boldly original young writer with a knock-out page presence, A Year Without a Name is a searching, lyrical memoir of transformation as well as a delicately observed portrait of youth.",

An avid reader, his dreams of being an acclaimed novelist came true. His desire to find love was fulfilled when he married brilliant executive Kathleen Atwater, the first female student accepted at Duke University's School of Engineering. The Petersons seemed the ideal academic couple- well-respected, prosperous, and happy. <br><br>All that came crashing down in December of 2001, when Kathleen apparently fell to her death in their secluded home in an exclusive area of Durham, North Carolina. But blood-spattered evidence and a missing fireplace poker suggested calculated, cold-blooded murder. Her trusted husband stood accused. Prosecutors introduced evidence at trial that sixteen years earlier, Peterson was one of the last people to see his neighbor alive before she was found dead at the bottom of a staircase in her home in Germany. A dramatic trial followed in the explosive final chapter of a life that no novelist could ever have conceived...</p>",

      "description": "<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER \u2022 Gillian Flynn\u2019s Edgar Award-winning homage to the classic ghost story, published for the first time as a standalone.</b><br><br>A canny young woman is struggling to survive by perpetrating various levels of mostly harmless fraud. On a rainy April morning, she is reading auras at Spiritual Palms when Susan Burke walks in. A keen observer of human behavior, our unnamed narrator immediately diagnoses beautiful, rich Susan as an unhappy woman eager to give her lovely life a drama injection. However, when the \"psychic\" visits the eerie Victorian home that has been the source of Susan\u2019s terror and grief, she realizes she may not have to pretend to believe in ghosts anymore. Miles, Susan\u2019s teenage stepson, doesn\u2019t help matters with his disturbing manner and grisly imagination. The three are soon locked in a chilling battle to discover where the evil truly lurks and what, if anything, can be done to escape it. <br><br>\u201cThe Grownup,\u201d which originally appeared as \u201cWhat Do You Do?\u201d in George R. R. Martin\u2019s <i>Rogues</i> anthology, proves once again that Gillian Flynn is one of the world\u2019s most original and skilled voices in fiction.",

Molly Parker has everything in her life totally in control, except for her complete awkwardness with just about anyone besides her mom.

She just\u2026hasn\u2019t actually talked to her yet. <br> <br>Alex and Molly don\u2019t belong on the same planet, let alone the same college campus. But when Alex, fresh off a bad (but hopefully not permanent) breakup, discovers Molly\u2019s hidden crush as their paths cross the night before classes start, they realize they might have a common interest after all. Because maybe if Alex volunteers to help Molly learn how to get her dream girl to fall for her, she can prove to her ex that she\u2019s not a selfish flirt. That she\u2019s ready for an actual commitment. And while Alex is the last person Molly would ever think she could trust, she can\u2019t deny Alex knows what she\u2019s doing with girls, unlike her. <br> <br>As the two embark on their five-step plans to get their girls to fall for them, though, they both begin to wonder if maybe they\u2019re the ones falling\u2026for each other.",

It is a vivid testimony to a life cut short, and testimony too, to the bravery and compassion of Judy and Dennis--Matthew's parents--as they struggle to survive a grief that won't go away.\"--Larry McMurty, author of <i>Terms of Endearment</i> and <i>Lonesome Dove</i></b><br> <br> Today the name Matthew Shepard is synonymous with gay rights, but until 1998, he was just Judy Shepard's son. In this remarkably candid memoir, Judy Shepard shares the story behind the headlines. Interweaving memories of Matthew and her family with the challenges of confronting her son's death, Judy describes how she handled the crippling loss of her child in the public eye, the vigils and protests held by strangers in her son's name, and ultimately how she and her husband gained the courage to help prosecutors convict her son's murderers.<br> <br> <i>The Meaning of Matthew</i> is more than a retelling of horrific injustice that brought the reality of inequality and homophobia into the American consciousness. It is an unforgettable and inspiring account of how one ordinary woman turned an unthinkable tragedy into a vital message for the world.",

When a man slaps another couple\u2019s child at a neighborhood barbecue, the event send unforeseeable shock waves through the lives of all who are witness to it. Told from the points of view of eight people who were present,\u00a0<i>The Slap</i>\u00a0shows how a single action can change the way people think about how they live, what they want, and what they believe forever.",

      "description": "<p>In <i>The Undertaking of Lily Chen</i>, Deshi, a hapless young man living in northern China, is suddenly expelled from ordinary life when his brother dies in an accident. Holding Deshi responsible for his brother's death, his parents send him on a mission to acquire a corpse bride to accompany his brother into the afterlife, in accordance with an ancient Chinese tradition that has many modern adherents. Eligible dead girls are in short supply, however. When Deshi falls into company with a young--and single--woman named Lily, he sees a solution to his problems. The only hitch is that willful, tart-tongued Lily is still very much alive. As Deshi and Lily adventure through a breathtaking mountain landscape, meeting a host of eccentric characters and dangerous adversaries along the way, Deshi just can't decide whether to kiss the girl or to kill her.<br><br>Danica Novgorodoff, author of <i>Slow Storm</i> and <i>Refresh, Refresh</i>, brings her distinctive voice and gorgeous, moody watercolors to this wry, beautiful, and surprising literary graphic novel.</p>",

      "description": "A decade ago, Darrow was the hero of the revolution he believed would break the chains of the Society, and abolish the color-coded caste system. But the Rising has shattered everything, and brought endless war. New foes emerge to threaten what has been earned, and throughout the worlds other destinies entwine with Darrow's to change his fate forever. A young Red girl flees tragedy in her refugee camp, and achieves for herself a new life she could never have imagined. An ex-soldier broken by grief is forced to steal the most valuable thing in the galaxy -- or pay with his life. And Lysander au Lune, the heir in exile to the Sovereign, wanders the stars with his mentor, Cassius, haunted by the loss of the world that Darrow transformed, and dreaming of what will rise from its ashes--Publisher's description.",

Terry Pratchett</p><p>Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch admits he may not be the sharpest knife in the cutlery drawer\u2014he might not even be a spoon. But he's dogged and honest and he'll be damned if he lets anyone disturb his city's always-tentative peace\u2014and that includes a rabble-rousing dwarf from the sticks (or deep beneath them) who's been stirring up big trouble on the eve of the anniversary of one of Discworld's most infamous historical events.</p><p>Centuries earlier, in a gods-forsaken hellhole called Koom Valley, a horde of trolls met a division of dwarfs in bloody combat. Though nobody's quite sure why they fought or who actually won, hundreds of years on each species still bears the cultural scars, and one views the other with simmering animosity and distrust. Lately, an influential dwarf, Grag Hamcrusher, has been fomenting unrest among Ankh-Morpork's more diminutive citizens with incendiary speeches. And it doesn't help matters when the pint-size provocateur is discovered beaten to death ... with a troll club lying conveniently nearby.</p><p>Vimes knows the well-being of his smoldering city depends on his ability to solve the Hamcrusher homicide without delay. (Vimes's secondmost-pressing responsibility, in fact, next to being home every evening at six sharp to read Where's My Cow? to Young Sam.) Whatever it takes to unstick this very sticky situation, Vimes will do it\u2014even tolerate having a vampire in the Watch. But there's more than one corpse waiting for him in the eerie, summoning darkness of the vast, labyrinthine mine network the dwarfs have been excavating in secret beneath Ankh-Morpork's streets. A deadly puzzle is pulling Sam Vimes deep into the muck and mire of superstition, hatred, and fear\u2014and perhaps all the way to Koom Valley itself.</p>",

A lyrical, aching young adult romance perfect for fans of <i>The Poet X, Darius the Great is Not Okay</i>, and <i>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Universe</i>.<br></b><br>For as long as they can remember, Aaron and Oliver have only ever had each other. In a small town with few queer teenagers, let alone young trans men, they\u2019ve shared milestones like coming out as trans, buying the right binders\u2014and falling for each other.<br><br>But just as their relationship has started to blossom, Aaron moves away. Feeling adrift, separated from the one person who understands them, they seek solace in digging deep into the annals of America\u2019s past. When they discover the story of two Revolutionary War soldiers who they believe to have been trans man in love, they\u2019re inspired to pay tribute to these soldiers by adopting their names\u2014Aaron and Oliver. As they learn, they delve further into unwritten queer stories, and they discover the transformative power of reclaiming one\u2019s place in history. <br><br>Further reading on trans history is included in backmatter.</p>",

Perfect for fans of Erika L. S\u00e1nchez, Leah Johnson, and Gabby Rivera.</p><p>Sixteen-year-old Yamilet Flores prefers to be known for her killer eyeliner, not for being one of the only Mexican kids at her new, mostly white, very rich Catholic school. But at least here no one knows she\u2019s gay, and Yami intends to keep it that way.\u00a0</p><p>After being outed by her crush and ex-best friend before transferring to Slayton Catholic, Yami has new priorities: keep her brother out of trouble, make her mom proud, and, most importantly, don\u2019t fall in love. Granted, she\u2019s never been great at any of those things, but that\u2019s a problem for Future Yami.\u00a0</p><p>The thing is, it\u2019s hard to fake being straight when Bo, the only openly queer girl at school, is so annoyingly perfect. And smart. And talented. And cute. So cute. Either way, Yami isn\u2019t going to make the same mistake again. If word got back to her mom, she could face a lot worse than rejection. So she\u2019ll have to start asking, WWSGD: What would a straight girl do?\u00a0</p><p>Told in a captivating voice that is by turns hilarious, vulnerable, and searingly honest, The Lesbiana\u2019s Guide to Catholic School explores the joys and heartaches of living your full truth out loud.</p>",

These are children who know only fear when they see an Israeli soldier or come across a roadblock. <br><br>This book provides a platform for children and young people, from all over this occupied land, to speak in their own voices about the day-to-day experience of living under occupation. It begins with an explanation of what the occupation means for those living under it, and is followed by the heart of the book: nine sections, each one focusing on one of the places visited by the authors. At the end, there is a timeline showing the main events that led up to the occupation.<br><br>As you read their words, you will see that what these young people want is a stable family life, security where they live, the freedom to move around their country, safety and space in which to grow up and dream of a future. They are just like young people everywhere; it is only the circumstances of their lives that are so different.<br><br>The young people in this book share with you their hopes and fears for themselves and their country and in so doing lay open their humanity.",

He had been born in the body of a girl and there seemed to be no relief in sight.<br> <br> In this revolutionary memoir, Arin details the journey that led him to make the life-transforming decision to undergo gender reassignment as a high school junior. In his captivatingly witty, honest voice, Arin reveals the challenges he faced as a girl, the humiliation and anger he felt after getting kicked out of his private school, and all the changes\u2014both mental and physical\u2014he experienced once his transition began. Arin also writes about the thrill of meeting and dating a young transgender woman named Katie Rain Hill\u2014and the heartache that followed after they broke up.<br> <br> <i>Some Assembly Required</i> is a true coming-of-age story about knocking down obstacles and embracing family, friendship, and first love. But more than that, it is a reminder that self-acceptance does not come ready-made with a manual and spare parts. Rather, some assembly is always required.",

Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, <i>Between the World and Me </i>clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.",

Who cracked Germany's Enigma code and shortened World War II? Who successfully lobbied the US Congress to outlaw child labor? And who organized the 1963 March on Washington? Ls, Gs, Bs, and Ts, that's who.<br> <br> Given today's news, it would be easy to get the impression that the campaign for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality is a recent development, but it is only the final act in a struggle that started more than a century ago. The history is told through personal stories and firsthand accounts of the movement's key events, like the 1950s \"Lavender Scare,\" the Stonewall Inn uprising, and the AIDS crisis. Kids will learn about civil rights mavericks, like Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, founder of the first gay rights organization; Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who turned the Daughters of Bilitis from a lesbian social club into a powerhouse for LGBT freedom; Christine Jorgensen, the nation's first famous transgender; and Harvey Milk, the first out candidate to win a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Also chronicled are the historic contributions of famous LGBT individuals, from General von Steuben and Alan Turing to Jane Addams and Bayard Rustin, among others. This up-to-date history includes the landmark Supreme Court decision making marriage equality the law of the land. Twenty-one activities enliven the history and demonstrate the spirited ways the LGBT community has pushed for positive social change.<br> <br> Kids can: write a free verse poem like Walt Whitman; learn \"The Madison\" line dance; remember a loved one with a quilt panel; perform a monologue from <i>The Laramie Project; </i>make up a song parody; and much more.",

I am hopelessly devoted to this summer dream of a book.\" \u2014Becky Albertalli, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda</i><br></b><br><b>The guy of her dreams... or the girl in her heart? </b><br><br>Lara's had eyes for exactly one person throughout her three years of high school: Chase Harding. He's tall, strong, sweet, a football star, and frankly, stupid hot. Oh, and he's talking to her now. On purpose and everything. Maybe...flirting, even? No, wait, he's definitely flirting, which is pretty much the sum of everything Lara's wanted out of life.<br><br>Except she\u2019s haunted by a memory. A memory of a confusing, romantic, strangely perfect summer spent with a girl named Jasmine. A memory that becomes a confusing, disorienting present when Jasmine herself walks through the front doors of the school to see Lara and Chase chatting it up in front of the lockers.<br><br>Lara has everything she ever wanted: a tight-knit group of friends, a job that borders on cool, and Chase, the boy of her literal dreams. But if she's finally got the guy, why can't she stop thinking about the girl?<br><br>Dahlia Adler's <i>Cool for the Summer</i> is a story of self-discovery and new love. It\u2019s about the things we want and the things we need. And it\u2019s about the people who will let us be who we are.</p>",

Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them.<br><br>What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.<br><br>This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.</p>",

Su autor, seleccionado por \"Newsweek\" como uno de los diez nuevos rostros para el noventa y seis, nos transporta desde los pueblos y parajes polvorientos de su tierra natal, la Republica Dominicana, hasta los barrios industrials y el paisaje urbano de New Jersey, bajo un horizonte de chimeneas humeantes. La obra triunfal que marco el arranque literario de Junot Diaz puede ahora disfrutarse en una edicion en espanol que conserva en su integridad la fuerza desabrida y la delicadeza del texto original.Los ninos y jovenes que pueblan las paginas de \"Negocios\" gravitan sin sosiego por territorios marginales, a mitad de camino entre la inocencia y la experiencia, entre la curiosidad infantil y la crueldad mas descarnada. Criados en hogares abandonados por el padre, donde todo se sostiene gracias a la ferrea abegacion de la madre, estos adolescentes acarician suenos de independencia, asomandose con recelo a un mundo donde intuyen que no hay un lugar reservado para ellos. En estos diez relatos la prosa de Junot Diaz oscila con sabiduria entre el humor, la desolacion y la ternura, desplegando en cada pagina un estilo palpitante de vida.",

As they become more aware of their aunts' mysterious and sometimes frightening powers -- and as their own powers begin to surface -- the sisters grow determined to escape their strange upbringing by blending into \"normal\" society. <br>But both find that they cannot elude their magic-filled past. And when trouble strikes -- in the form of a menacing backyard ghost -- the sisters must not only reunite three generations of Owens women but embrace their magic as a gift -- and their key to a future of love and passion. Funny, haunting, and shamelessly romantic, \"Practical Magic\" is bewitching entertainment -- Alice Hoffman at her spectacular best.",

She wants to have that experience too (well, not <i>exactly</i> like that--but with someone she trusts and actually likes), so she's going to need to find <i>the</i> guy, and fast. Problem is, she's known all the boys in her small high school forever, and it's kinda hard to be into a guy when you watched him eat crayons in kindergarten.<br><br>So she can't believe her luck when she meets a ridiculously hot new guy named Dean. Not only does he look like he's fallen out of a classic movie poster, but he drives a motorcycle, flirts with ease, and might actually be into her.<br><br>But Dean's already in college, and Keely is convinced he'll drop her if he finds out how inexperienced she is. That's when she talks herself into a new plan: her lifelong best friend, Andrew, would never hurt or betray her, and he's clearly been with enough girls that he can show her the ropes before she goes all the way with Dean. Of course, the plan only works if Andrew and Keely stay friends--<i>just</i> friends--so things are about to get complicated.<br><br>Cameron Lund's delightful debut is a hilarious and heartfelt story of first loves, first friends, and first times--and how making them your own is all that really matters.",

      "description": "A vivid, funny, and viscerally powerful memoir about childhood, assimilation, food, and growing up in the 1980s <br> As a Vietnamese girl coming of age in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Bich Nguyen is filled with a rapacious hunger for American identity. In the pre-PC era Midwest, where the devoutly Christian blond-haired, blue-eyed Jennifers and Tiffanys reign supreme, Nguyen's barely conscious desire to belong transmutes into a passion for American food. More exotic seeming than her Buddhist grandmother's traditional specialties?spring rolls, delicate pancakes stuffed with meats, fried shrimp cakes?the campy, preservative-filled ?delicacies? of mainstream America capture her imagination. And in this remarkable book, the glossy branded allure of such American foods as Pringles, Kit Kats, and Toll House cookies become an ingenious metaphor for her struggle to fit in, to become a ?real? American. <p> Beginning with Nguyen's family's harrowing migration from Saigon in 1975, \"Stealing Buddha's Dinner\" is nostalgic and candid, deeply satisfying and minutely observed, and stands as a unique vision of the immigrant experience and a lyrical ode to how identity is often shaped by the things we long for.",

So Anna \"borrows\" her stepmom's credit card and runs away to Los Angeles, where her half-sister takes her in. But LA isn't quite the glamorous escape Anna had imagined.<br><br>As Anna spends her days on TV and movie sets, she engrosses herself in a project researching the murderous Manson girls\u2014and although the violence in her own life isn't the kind that leaves physical scars, she begins to notice the parallels between herself and the lost girls of LA, and of America, past and present.<br><br>In Anna's singular voice, we glimpse not only a picture of life on the B-list in LA, but also a clear-eyed reflection on being young, vulnerable, lost, and female in America\u2014in short, on the B-list of life. Alison Umminger writes about girls, violence, and which people society deems worthy of caring about, which ones it doesn't, in a way not often seen in teen fiction.<br><br><b><i>American Girls</i> is:</b><br><b><br>An ALA <i>Booklist</i> Top 10 First Novel </b><b><br>A </b><b><i>Kirkus</i> </b><b>Best Book of the Year</b><b><br>A Barnes & Noble Best YA Book of the Year</b><br><b>A Chicago Public Library Best of the Best of 2016</b><br><b>A Bustle Best YA Book of the Year</b><br><b>YALSA</b><b>'s</b><b> Best Fiction for Young Adults</b><br><br>\"Messy, honest, and unflinchingly real.

      "description": "<b>A brave firsthand account of online personality Alex Bertie's life, struggles, and victories as a transgender teen, as well as a groundbreaking guide for transitioning teens.</b><b><br></b>Long before he became known for his YouTube videos, Alex Bertie was an isolated, often-afraid transgender teenager looking for answers. In this revolutionary memoir and valuable resource, Alex recounts his life, struggles, and victories as a young trans man. Along the way, he provides readers with accessible, highly researched explanations of gender, sexuality, and transitions. He explores without judgment how complicated all these things can be, and how many equally authentic ways there are to live as yourself and find happiness. <br><br>It can be hard for questioning teens to believe in a brighter future, let alone find any sense of community. Here, with clarity and compassion, Alex writes as a supportive older brother for transitioning teens, their allies, their parents, and anyone looking to better understand others -- and themselves.",

But in her sixteenth year, Vicky is unceremoniously shipped off to London to find a husband. With her usual aplomb, however, Lady Victoria gets herself engaged to the perfect English gentleman, even before setting foot on British soil.</p><p>The Rogue</p><p>Hugo Rothschild, ninth earl of Malfrey, is everything a girl could want in a future husband: he is handsome and worldly, if not rich. Lady Victoria has everything just as she'd like it. That is, if raffish young ship captain Jacob Carstairs would leave well enough alone.</p><p>Jacob's meddling is nothing short of exasperating, and Victoria is mystified by his persistence. But when it becomes clear that young Lord Malfrey just might not be all that he's professed to be, Victoria is forced to admit, for the first time in her life, that she is wrong. Not only about her fiance, but about the reason behind the handsome ship captain's interference.</p>",

      "description": "<p>\"Longtime therapist and sex educator Langford has written an indispensable guide to a universe of things sexual and social for LGBTQ+ youth and their parents or caregivers.\" Booklist, Starred Review</p><p>Sex education materials meant to explain important basics to kids are too-often not written with an empathic understanding of what those basics are. This is particularly obvious regarding books that include LGBTQ identities. Even when they do hit the mark, many have a limited scope and don\u2019t take into account the practical realities of developing sexuality. </p><p>The Pride Guide is written explicitly for the almost ten percent of teenagers who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans, or any of the unique identities that are not heterosexual/ cisgendered. It explores sex, dating, relationships, puberty, and both physical and online safety in one resource.</p><p>The issue, today, is not whether or not queer youth will get sex education. The issue is how and where they will gather information and whether or not the information they gather with be applicable, unreliable, or exploitative. Equipping teens and their families with knowledge and self-confidence, this work provides the best protection against the unfortunate consequences that sometimes accompany growing up with an alternative gender or identity.</p><p>With real-world information presented in a factual and humorous way, responsible adults can teach queer youth to (and how to) protect themselves, to find resources, to explore who they are, and to interact with the world around them while being true to themselves and respectful of others. </p><p><br>Written with these issues in mind, The Pride Guide covers universal topics that apply to everyone, such as values clarification, digital citizenship, responsibility, information regarding abstinence as well as indulgence, and an understanding of the consequences and results of both action and inaction. For LGBTQ youth, this is a resource containing information on the unique issues queer youth face regarding what puberty looks like (particularly for trans youth), dating skills and violence, activism, personal safety, and above all, pride.</p><p><br>Parents and other supportive adults who are motivated to educate themselves and who are interested in gaining some tools and skills around making these necessary conversations less uncomfortable and more effective will benefit from this book. The go-to resource for making informed decisions, The Pride Guide is indispensable for teens, parents, educators, and others hoping to support the safe journey of LGBTQ teens on their journey of discovery.</p>",

      "description": "<p>A TOP 10 RAINBOW LIST BOOK</p><p>William C. Morris YA Debut Award nominee Carrie Mesrobian delivers a \u201craw, sympathetic coming-of-age story [that] uncovers the messy, painful, yet vitally important process of self-discovery\u201d (Booklist, starred review) when a high school senior comes to terms with his attraction to both his girlfriend and his male best friend.</p><p>It took Will Caynes seventeen years to have his first kiss. He should be ecstatic\u2026except that it was with his best friend, Angus, while they were both drunk and stoned. Will\u2019s not gay, but he did sort of enjoy whatever it was he felt with Angus. Unsettled by his growing interest in Angus, Will avoids his friend and even starts dating a sophomore, Brandy. When he\u2019s hooking up with her, he\u2019s totally into it, so he must be straight, right? Then why does he secretly keep going back to Angus?</p><p>Confusing as Will\u2019s feelings are, they\u2019re a welcome distraction from his complicated home life. His father has started drinking earlier each day when he should be working on never-ending house renovations. And his mom\u2014divorced and living in a McMansion with her new husband\u2014isn\u2019t much help, unless she\u2019s buying Will a bunch of stuff he doesn\u2019t need. Between the two of them, neither feels like much of a parent\u2014which leaves Will on his own in figuring things out with his girlfriend and best friend. He loves them both, but deciding who to be with will ultimately hurt someone. Himself, probably the most. </p>",

But after a photo of her dressed as Rosie the Riveter is mocked online, she's having trouble seeing the good in the world. As a result, Poppy trades her beloved vintage clothes for a feathered chicken costume and accepts a job as an anonymous sign waver outside a restaurant. There, Poppy meets six-year-old girl Miracle, who helps Poppy see beyond her own pain, opening her eyes to the people around her: Cam, her twin brother, who is adjusting to life as an openly gay teen; Buck, a charming photographer with a cute British accent and a not-so-cute mean-streak; and Lewis a teen caring for an ailing parent, while struggling to reach the final stages of his gender transition. As the summer unfolds, Poppy stops glorifying the past and starts focusing on the present. But just as she comes to terms with the fact that there is good and bad in everyone, she is tested by a deep betrayal.",

Together they have stepped in for their alcoholic, wayward mother to take care of their three younger siblings. As de facto parents to the little ones, Lochan and Maya have had to grow up fast. And the stress of their lives\u2014and the way they understand each other so completely\u2014has also brought them closer than two siblings would ordinarily be. So close, in fact, that they have fallen in love. Their clandestine romance quickly blooms into deep, desperate love. They know their relationship is wrong and cannot possibly continue. And yet, they cannot stop what feels so incredibly right. As the novel careens toward an explosive and shocking finale, only one thing is certain: A love this devastating has no happy ending.",

      "description": "Seeing Gender is an of-the-moment investigation into how we express and understand the complexities of gender today. Deeply researched and fully illustrated, this book demystifies an intensely personal\u2014yet universal\u2014facet of humanity. Illustrating a different concept on each spread, queer author and artist Iris Gottlieb touches on history, science, sociology, and her own experience. This book is an essential tool for understanding and contributing to a necessary cultural conversation, bringing clarity and reassurance to the sometimes confusing process of navigating ones' identity. Whether LGBTQ+, cisgender, or nonbinary, Seeing Gender is a must-read for intelligent, curious, want-to-be woke people who care about how we see and talk about gender and sexuality in the 21st century.",

Defying the feud which divides their families, Romeo and Juliet enjoy the fleeting rapture of courtship, marriage and sexual fulfilment; but a combination of old animosities and new coincidences brings them to suicidal deaths.</p> <p>This play offers a rich mixture of romantic lyricism, bawdy comedy, intimate harmony and sudden violence. Long successful in the theatre, it has also generated numerous operas, ballets and films; and these have helped to make Romeo and Juliet perennially topical.</p>",

But racist thought is not just alive and well in America -- it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit.<br> <br> <br> <br> In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis.<br> <br> <br> <br> As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched racist policies and the nation's racial inequities.<br> <br> <br> <br> In shedding light on this history, <i>Stamped from the Beginning</i> offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope.",

As if that wasn't unusual enough, her scythe is a demon scythe called Soul Eater, which can change form from a scythe to a human-looking boy. In order to make Soul Eater powerful enough to be Death's Weapon, he must eat the souls of 99 humans and 1 witch. Along the way, the two of them face many different challenges, including a cat witch named Blair (who happens to have a thing for Soul) and a teacher who's been turned into a zombie (and wants him to join her!). Her fellow students, like the shadow ninja weapon meister named Black Star who always needs to be the center of attention, aren't much help, either. It'll be a miracle if Maka even survives, let alone manages to make Soul Eater into the Death Scythe.",

Bello, intelligente, campione nello sport, amico perfetto, figlio perfetto, il rubacuori della scuola. \u00c8 perfino affettuoso e adorabile con suo fratello. Karen, la madre di Max, \u00e8 un avvocato di grido, determinata a mantenere la facciata di naturale eccellenza che ha costruito in anni e anni. Ma ora che i suoi figli stanno diventando grandi e che lei sta perdendo il controllo su di loro, inizia a temere che quella facciata possa sgretolarsi. Ad aumentare la tensione, suo marito Steve ha deciso di candidarsi alle elezioni e i riflettori di tutti i media nazionali sono puntati sulla loro casa. I Walker hanno un segreto da nascondere. Max \u00e8 speciale. Max \u00e8 differente. Max \u00e8 \"intersex\". E quando un enigmatico amico d'infanzia ricompare per metterlo di fronte alla sua difficile identit\u00e0, Max \u00e8 costretto a guardare in faccia il suo ben protetto segreto. Perch\u00e9 i genitori non ne parlano? Cosa gli stanno in realt\u00e0 nascondendo?

But when she trips into a quiet boy in the hall, Jaime Thompson, she's already broken the first rule, and the mean kids start calling her the \"nerder girlfriend.\" How does she handle this crisis? By shoving poor Jaime and running away!<br>Falling back on rule two and surrounding herself with new friends in the art club, Peppi still can't help feeling ashamed about the way she treated Jaime. Things are already awkward enough between the two, but to make matters worse, he's a member of her own club's archrivals--the science club! And when the two clubs go to war, Peppi realizes that sometimes you have to break the rules to survive middle school!",
