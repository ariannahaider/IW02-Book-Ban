The legendary actress, producer, and comedian steps into the Who Was? spotlight.</b><br><br>Much like her hit TV show,\u00a0<i>I Love Lucy,</i>\u00a0Americans in the 1950s fell in love with Lucy. Born in New York in 1911, Lucille Ball was always a natural performer. She danced in the chorus of Broadway shows and acted in small parts in Hollywood movies. But Ball's true gift was comedy. She found a way to showcase her gifts in 1951 when CBS gave her the chance to star in a sitcom. She based the show on her life and called it\u00a0<i>I Love Lucy.</i>\u00a0Over sixty years later, it is still one of the most loved television shows of all time. Lucille Ball became the first woman to run a major television studio, Desilu, and her comedic genius has kept people laughing for generations.",

      "description": "Which acts by educators are ''racist'' and which are ''antiracist''? How can an educator constructively discuss complex issues of race with students and colleagues? In Everyday Antiracism leading educators deal with the most challenging questions about race in school, offering invaluable and effective advice. Contributors including Beverly Daniel Tatum, Sonia Nieto, and Pedro Noguera describe concrete ways to analyze classroom interactions that may or may not be ''racial,'' deal with racial inequality and ''diversity,'' and teach to high standards across racial lines. Topics range from using racial incidents as teachable moments and responding to the ''n-word'' to valuing students' home worlds, dealing daily with achievement gaps, and helping parents fight ethnic and racial misconceptions about their children. Questions following each essay prompt readers to examine and discuss everyday issues of race and opportunity in their own classrooms and schools. For educators and parents determined to move beyond frustrations about race, Everyday Antiracism is an essential tool.",

      "description": "<p><b>From author Kelly Quindlen comes a poignant and deeply relatable story about friendship, self-acceptance, and what it means to be a Real Teenager. <i>Late to the Party</i> is an ode to late bloomers and wallflowers everywhere.</b><br><br>Seventeen is nothing like Codi Teller imagined.<br><br>She\u2019s never crashed a party, never stayed out too late. She\u2019s never even been kissed. And it\u2019s not just because she\u2019s gay. It\u2019s because she and her two best friends, Maritza and JaKory, spend more time in her basement watching Netflix than engaging with the outside world.<br><br>So when Maritza and JaKory suggest crashing a party, Codi is highly skeptical. Those parties aren\u2019t for kids like them. They\u2019re for cool kids. <i>Straight</i> kids.<br><br>But then Codi stumbles upon one of those cool kids, Ricky, kissing another boy in the dark, and an unexpected friendship is formed. In return for <i>never</i> talking about that kiss, Ricky takes Codi under his wing and draws her into a wild summer filled with late nights, new experiences, and one really cute girl named Lydia. The only problem? Codi never tells Maritza or JaKory about any of it.</p>",

Some of these encounters are slights, seeming slips of the tongue, and some are intentional offensives in the classroom, at the supermarket, at home, on the tennis court with Serena Williams and the soccer field with Zinedine Zidane, online, on TV-everywhere, all the time. The accumulative stresses come to bear on a person's ability to speak, perform, and stay alive. Our addressability is tied to the state of our belonging, Rankine argues, as are our assumptions and expectations of citizenship. In essay, image, and poetry, <i>Citizen</i> is a powerful testament to the individual and collective effects of racism in our contemporary, often named \"post-race\" society.</p>",

      "description": "<b>This powerfully illustrated picture book biography tells the courageous life story of Wilma Mankiller, the first female chief of the Cherokee Nation.</b><br><br> As a child in Oklahoma, Wilma Mankiller experienced the Cherokee practice of Gadugi, helping each other, even when times were hard for everyone. But in 1956, the federal government uprooted her family and moved them to California, wrenching them from their home, friends, and traditions. Separated from her community and everything she knew, Wilma felt utterly lost until she found refuge in the Indian Center in San Francisco. There, she worked to build and develop the local Native community and championed Native political activists. She took her two children to visit tribal communities in the state, and as she introduced them to the traditions of their heritage, she felt a longing for home.<br><br> Returning to Oklahoma with her daughters, Wilma took part in Cherokee government. Despite many obstacles, from resistance to female leadership to a life-threatening accident, Wilma's courageous dedication to serving her people led to her election as the first female chief of the Cherokee Nation. As leader and advocate, she reinvigorated her constituency by empowering them to identify and solve community problems.<br><br> This beautiful addition to the Big Words series will inspire future leaders to persevere in empathy and thoughtful problem-solving, reaching beyond themselves to help those around them. Moving prose by award-winning author Doreen Rappaport is interwoven with Wilma's own words in this expertly researched biography, illustrated with warmth and vivacity by Linda Kukuk.<br><br><b>Don\u2019t miss these other titles in the Big Words series!</b><br><b><i>Ellen Takes Flight: The Life of Astronaut Ellen Ochoa</i></b><br><b><i>Ruth Objects: The Life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg</i></b><br><b><i>Helen\u2019s Big World: The Life of Helen Keller</i></b><br><b><i>Abe\u2019s Honest Words: The Life of Abraham Lincoln</i></b><br><b><i>Martin\u2019s Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</i></b>",

By age 15, he found himself the undisputed leader of six million people who were facing the threat of a full-scale war from the Chinese. After the defeat of the Tibetan national uprising in 1959, the Dalai Lama had to flee Tibet and went into exile in India. For nearly 50 years, he has aimed to establish Tibet as a self-governing, democratic state. In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent efforts for the liberation of Tibet and his concern for global environmental problems. As the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama continues to spend his life working to benefit humanity and preserving Tibetan culture.",

Slavery was a major industry in the American South, and Stowe worked with the Underground Railroad to help escaped slaves head north towards freedom. The publication of her book, <i>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, </i>a scathing anti-slavery novel, fanned the flames that started the Civil War. The book\u2019s emotional portrayal of the impact of slavery captured the nation\u2019s attention. A best-seller in its time, <i>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin</i> sealed Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s reputations as one of the most influential anti-slavery voices in US history.",

The first is that he and his big brother, Ernie, are leaving Brooklyn for the very first time to spend the summer with their grandparents all the way in Virginia\u2014in the COUNTRY! The second surprise comes when Genie figures out that their grandfather is blind. Thunderstruck, Genie peppers Grandpop with questions about how he hides it so well (besides wearing way cool Ray-Bans).<br> <br>How does he match his clothes? Know where to walk? Cook with a gas stove? Pour a glass of sweet tea without spilling it? Genie thinks Grandpop must be the bravest guy he\u2019s ever known, but he starts to notice that his grandfather never leaves the house\u2014as in NEVER. And when he finds the secret room that Grandpop is always disappearing into\u2014a room so full of songbirds and plants that it\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s been pulled inside-out\u2014he begins to wonder if his grandfather is really so brave after all.<br> <br>Then Ernie lets him down in the bravery department. It\u2019s his fourteenth birthday, and, Grandpop says to become a man, you have to learn how to shoot a gun. Genie thinks that is AWESOME until he realizes Ernie has no interest in learning how to shoot. None. Nada. Dumbfounded by Ernie\u2019s reluctance, Genie is left to wonder\u2014is bravery and becoming a man only about proving something, or is it just as important to own up to what you won\u2019t do?",

You must mind the one taking care of you, but she\u2019s not your mama.\u201d Ashley Rhodes-Courter spent nine years of her life in fourteen different foster homes, living by those words. As her mother spirals out of control, Ashley is left clinging to an unpredictable, dissolving relationship, all the while getting pulled deeper and deeper into the foster care system.<br> <br>Painful memories of being taken away from her home quickly become consumed by real-life horrors, where Ashley is juggled between caseworkers, shuffled from school to school, and forced to endure manipulative, humiliating treatment from a very abusive foster family. In this inspiring, unforgettable memoir, Ashley finds the courage to succeed\u2014and in doing so, discovers the power of speaking out.",

If Magnus Chase and his friends can't retrieve the hammer quickly, the mortal worlds will be defenseless against an onslaught of giants. Ragnarok will begin. The Nine Worlds will burn. Unfortunately, the only person who can broker a deal for the hammer's return is the gods' worst enemy, Loki--and the price he wants is very high.</p>",

Now he shares the same gift of storytelling with a new generation.<br> Hiawatha was a strong and articulate Mohawk who was chosen to translate the Peacemaker\u2019s message of unity for the five warring Iroquois nations during the 14th century. This message not only succeeded in uniting the tribes but also forever changed how the Iroquois governed themselves\u2014a blueprint for democracy that would later inspire the authors of the U.S. Constitution.<br> Caldecott Honor\u2013winning illustrator David Shannon brings the journey of Hiawatha and the Peacemaker to life with arresting oil paintings. Together, the team of Robertson and Shannon has crafted a new children\u2019s classic that will both educate and inspire readers of all ages.<br> Includes a CD featuring an original song written and performed by Robbie Robertson.",

      "description": "<b>This unique picture book biography tells the story of Dr. James Barry, born female, who lived as a man from age 18 to his death.</b><br><br>Like other girls of her time, Margaret Bulkley didn't go to school. She wouldn't grow up to own property, be a soldier, a doctor, or hold any job other than perhaps maid or governor--such was a girl's lot in 19th century England. And was she comfortable born in a girl's body? We will never know. What we do know is that at the age of 18, she tugged off her stockings and dress, cut her red-gold curls, and vanished. In her place appeared a young man. Margaret became James Barry. James would attend medical school, become a doctor and a soldier, travel the world. He would fall in love, deliver babies, and fight in a duel. And he would live a rich full life.<br><br>Here is a picure book that is both a fascinating and sensitively drawn portrait of someone who would not be undervalued, and an important introduction to the concept of gender identity.",

The Kostrovian royal court will be saved, of course, along with their guards. But the fate of the court's Royal Flyers, a lauded fleet of aerial silk performers, is less certain. Hell-bent on survival, Principal Flyer, Natasha Koskinen, will do anything to save the flyers, who are the only family she's ever known. Even if \"anything\" means molding herself into the type of girl who could be courted by Prince Nikolai. But unbeknownst to Natasha, her newest recruit, Ella Neves, is driven less by her desire to survive the floods than her thirst for revenge. And Ella's mission could put everything Natasha has worked for in peril. <br><br>As the oceans rise, so too does an undeniable spark between the two flyers. With the end of the world looming, and dark secrets about the Kostrovian court coming to light, Ella and Natasha can either give in to despair . . . or find a new reason to live.",

Thousands of futures got a little brighter and a great American art form was born. <br><br> In 1891, Reverend Daniel Joseph Jenkins opened his orphanage in Charleston, South Carolina. He soon had hundreds of children and needed a way to support them. Jenkins asked townspeople to donate old band instruments\u2014some of which had last played in the hands of Confederate soldiers in the Civil War. He found teachers to show the kids how to play. Soon the orphanage had a band. And what a band it was. <br><br> The Jenkins Orphanage Band caused a sensation on the streets of Charleston. People called the band's style of music \"rag\"\u2014a rhythm inspired by the African American people who lived on the South Carolina and Georgia coast. The children performed as far away as Paris and London, and they earned enough money to support the orphanage that still exists today. They also helped launch the music we now know as jazz. <br><br><i>Hey, Charleston!</i> is the story of the kind man who gave America \"some rag\" and so much more.</p>",

      "description": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) young people in the 21st century can find unprecedented support in a proud, vibrant, and diverse community both online and off. The resources and ability to connect with LGBT people around the world are exciting and very new. This book explores the history of the LGBT community in America from its roots in the free-thinking seaport cities of the 1800s, through the social revolution of World War II, the early activists of the 1950s, the Pride movements of the 1970s, the AIDS crisis, and today's move toward integration with mainstream communities. It is a story of courage in the face of oppression, demanding civil rights, and LGBT people making meaningful and authentic lives for themselves--while having fun too. LGBT people today are the heirs of the hopes and dreams and hard work of past generations. This is an inspiring story of an American minority group that is still fighting for full equality. Each title in this series contains a foreword from the founder of the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN), color photos throughout, and back matter including: an index and further reading lists for books and internet resources. Key Icons appear throughout the books in this series in an effort to encourage library readers to build knowledge, gain awareness, explore possibilities and expand their viewpoints through our content rich non-fiction books. Key Icons in this series are as follows: Words to Understand are shown at the front of each chapter with definitions. These words are set in boldfaced type in that chapter, so that readers are able to reference back to the definitions--building their vocabulary and enhancing their reading comprehension. Sidebars are highlighted graphics with content rich material within that allows readers to build knowledge and broaden their perspectives by weaving together additional information to provide realistic and holistic perspectives. Text-Dependent Questions are placed at the end of each chapter. They challenge the reader's comprehension of the chapter they have just read, while sending the reader back to the text for more careful attention to the evidence presented there. Research Projects are provided at the end of each chapter as well and provide readers with suggestions for projects that encourage deeper research and analysis. And a Series Glossary of Key Terms is included in the back matter containing terminology used throughout the series. Words found here broaden the reader's knowledge and understanding of terms used in this field.",

      "description": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have long struggled with the conflict of being able to participate fully in their religious faith while remaining true to themselves. The good news is that today many LGBT people of faith are finding support and inclusion in religious communities that have entered the 21st century committed to the full inclusion of LGBT people. Learn how the world's major religious traditions--Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism--view homosexuality, and how LGBT people of faith navigate within those traditions. Examine why some religious groups still condemn homosexuality and reject LGBT people. And discover that while certain religions have always had a place for gay and lesbian people in their communities, others are working hard to create a place. Each title in this series contains a foreword from the founder of the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN), color photos throughout, and back matter including: an index and further reading lists for books and internet resources. Key Icons appear throughout the books in this series in an effort to encourage library readers to build knowledge, gain awareness, explore possibilities and expand their viewpoints through our content rich non-fiction books. Key Icons in this series are as follows: Words to Understand are shown at the front of each chapter with definitions. These words are set in boldfaced type in that chapter, so that readers are able to reference back to the definitions--building their vocabulary and enhancing their reading comprehension. Sidebars are highlighted graphics with content rich material within that allows readers to build knowledge and broaden their perspectives by weaving together additional information to provide realistic and holistic perspectives. Text-Dependent Questions are placed at the end of each chapter. They challenge the reader's comprehension of the chapter they have just read, while sending the reader back to the text for more careful attention to the evidence presented there. Research Projects are provided at the end of each chapter as well and provide readers with suggestions for projects that encourage deeper research and analysis. And a Series Glossary of Key Terms is included in the back matter containing terminology used throughout the series. Words found here broaden the reader's knowledge and understanding of terms used in this field.",

      "description": "This thought-provoking reference work explores the evolution of America's heated abortion debate in a selection of over 40 primary documents from the 19th century to the present day. The guide includes not only key laws and court cases that have determined abortion policy, but also political speeches, medical essays, theological writings, newspaper advertisements, magazine articles, and popular books that offer insight into America's changing attitudes towards women, race, the medical field, and the role of government in its citizens' personal lives. Each document is preceded by an introduction and is followed by analysis to help readers understand its significance and historical context.<br><br>Today abortion is America's most contentious political and religious rallying point. Yet 150 years ago it was a virtual non-issue, quietly performed for centuries by women and mid-wives. What changed? This thought-provoking reference work explores the evolution of America's abortion debate in a balanced selection of over 40 primary documents by doctors, feminists, religious leaders, politicians, extremists, and judges from the 19th century to the present day. This guide not only examines the key laws and court cases, like Roe v. Wade and the Partial Birth Abortion Ban, that have determined abortion policy, but offers insight into America's changing attitudes towards women, race, the medical field, and the role of government in its citizens' personal lives. Memoirs of early abortion providers, excerpts from popular women's self-help books, the complete text of Pope Paul VI's Humanae Vitae, and personal writings from key liberal and conservative figures on both sides of the debate provide a more complete picture of an issue that is deeply personal, deeply divisive, and anything but clear-cut. A straightforward and accessible book, ideal for both students and general readers looking to expand their understanding of one of the most complicated, and still unresolved, issues of our day.<br><br>Each excerpt is preceded by a brief explanation of its significance and followed by author analysis to help readers understand its implications and the historical context in which is it was written. Readers gain direct access to America's most important legal papers and transcripts on abortion, complimented by a well rounded view of the public beliefs and sentiments that have fueled abortion debates. Suggestions for further reading conclude each chapter, perfect for research or to guide interested readers in their search for material. The front matter includes a Timeline of major events in abortion history, and the back matter, offers a Bibliography of 50 titles on abortion and over 30 Web links.",

      "description": "Is it true that guys believe they're smarter than they really are? Or that girls talk more than guys? Do mosquitoes bite guys more than girls? Which sex is better at diapering babies, remembering birthdays, or hammering nails? These are just some of the questions to which you'll find some pretty astounding answers. Using scientific research, author Michael J. Rosen explores the ways in which environment and experience, as well as neurology, physiology, and genetics come together to shape personality and gender behavior?in both expected and unexpected ways. Amusing and informative, these quirky questions and answers will have males and females rethinking their notions of differences between the genders. So, really: Who is better at lying? Who should be more afraid of lightning? Who makes plants grow taller? Who's got more cooties? Guys or girls?",

As a child, she daydreamed about beats and lyrics, and hummed along with the music from her family's Majestic radio.</p> <p>At age seven, Melba fell in love with a big, shiny trombone, and soon taught herself to play the instrument. By the time she was a teenager, Melba's extraordinary gift for music led her to the world of jazz. She joined a band led by trumpet player Gerald Wilson and toured the country. Overcoming obstacles of race and gender, Melba went on to become a famed trombone player and arranger, spinning rhythms, harmonies, and melodies into gorgeous songs for all the jazz greats of the twentieth century: Randy Weston, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, and Quincy Jones, to name just a few.</p> <p>Brimming with ebullience and the joy of making music, <i>Little Melba and Her Big Trombone</i> is a fitting tribute to a trailblazing musician and a great unsung hero of jazz.</p>",

After a little push from Oskar, a local who is equal parts endearing and aloof, Miles decides to honor Vivian's life by photographing her treasured Doc Martens standing empty against the surreal landscapes.

Ten years ago, she witnessed the abduction of her best friend, Sibby. And though she told the police everything she remembered, it wasn't enough. Sibby was never seen again. At night, Dee deals with her guilt by becoming someone else: the Seeker, the voice behind the popular true crime podcast Radio Silent, which features missing persons cases and works with online sleuths to solve them. Nobody knows Dee's the Seeker, and she plans to keep it that way. When another little girl goes missing, and the case is linked to Sibby's disappearance, Dee has a chance to get answers, with the help of her virtual detectives and the intriguing new girl at school. But how much is she willing to reveal about herself in order to uncover the truth? Dee\u2019s about to find out what\u2019s really at stake in unraveling the mystery of the little girls who vanished.</p>",

As punishment for her behavior, she is forced to leave her heartbroken family behind and go work at their estate.<br><br>Amal is distraught but has faced setbacks before. So she summons her courage and begins navigating the complex rules of life as a servant, with all its attendant jealousies and pecking-order woes. Most troubling, though, is Amal's increasing awareness of the deadly measures the Khan family will go to in order to stay in control. It's clear that their hold over her village will never loosen as long as everyone is too afraid to challenge them--so if Amal is to have any chance of ensuring her loved ones' safety and winning back her freedom, she must find a way to work with the other servants to make it happen.",

They can hit every note of all the top pop and Broadway hits. But despite their talent, emotional scars from an incident with a homophobic classmate and their grandmother's spiraling dementia make it harder and harder for Carey to find their voice. <br><br>Then Carey meets Cris, a singer/guitarist who makes Carey feel seen for the first time in their life. With the rush of a promising new romantic relationship, Carey finds the confidence to audition for the role of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, in the school musical, setting off a chain reaction of prejudice by Carey's tormentor and others in the school. It's up to Carey, Cris, and their friends to defend their rights--and they refuse to be silenced. <br><br>Told in alternating chapters with identifying pronouns, debut author Steven Salvatore's <i>Can't Take That Away</i> conducts a powerful, uplifting anthem, a swoony romance, and an affirmation of self-identity that will ignite the activist in all of us.",

Luckily, he lives in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. Yet he yearns for the ocean and is determined to leave his hometown for a college on the coast. His best friend, Maria, however, wants nothing more than to stay in the desert, and Jake's mother encourages him to always play it safe.<br><br>There's nothing \"safe\" about Jake's future--not when he's attracted to Kenny Liu, swim team captain and rebel against conformity. And certainly not when he secretly applies to the University of Miami. Jake's life begins to outpace his small town's namesake, which doesn't make it any easier to come out to his mom, or Maria, or the world.<br><br>But Jake is full of secrets, including the strange blue markings on his skin that glow when in contact with water. What power will he find when he searches for his identity, and will he turn his back to the current or dive headfirst into the waves?",

In the early-morning hours of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall Inn was raided by police in New York City. Though the inn had been raided before, that night would be different. It would be the night when empowered members of the LGBTQ+ community--in and around the Stonewall Inn--began to protest and demand their equal rights as citizens of the United States. <br>Movingly narrated by the Stonewall Inn itself, and featuring stirring and dynamic illustrations, <i>Stonewall: A Building. An Uprising. A Revolution</i> is an essential and empowering civil rights story that every child deserves to hear.",

      "description": "For centuries, organized religion has been one of the main forces of prejudice and rejection of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. But the fact is, not all religious traditions are unfriendly to LGBT people, and some old ways of reading the Bible are being re-examined in new and welcoming ways. While many LGBT people struggle with the conflicts of being both religious and gay, many others are finding support and inclusion in religious communities that have entered the twenty-first century committed to the full inclusion of LGBT people. Learn about how the world's major religious traditions\u2014Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism\u2014view homosexuality, and how faithful LGBT people within these traditions deal with the issues they face. Examine some of the reasons why some religious groups continue to condemn homosexuality and reject LGBT people. And discover that many religions have always had a place for gay and lesbian people in their communities, and how others are working hard to create that place.",

But it's never felt like a big deal until his junior year of high school, when Ash gets his first period in front of the entire boys' soccer team. Now his friends and teachers see him differently, and his own mother thinks he should \"try being a girl.\" <br> <br> As tensions mount with his parents and Ash feels more and more like an outcast, he can't help feeling a deeper kinship with his ancestor Bridget Bishop, who was executed for witchcraft. She didn't conform to her community's expectations either; she was different, and her neighbors felt threatened by her. And she paid the ultimate price. Ash is haunted by her last recorded words: You will keep silent.<br> <br> Ash realizes that he needs to find a way to stand up for who he really is, or the cost of his silence might destroy his life, too.</p> <p>Praise for Just Ash: </p> <p> \"There are few books and even fewer authors who have endeavored to give readers a real glimpse into the life of an intersex teen, which is just one reason Santana's debut is so unique. . . . Santana\u2014who is intersex herself\u2014has written a smart and deeply introspective main character with whom readers will easily sympathize.\"\u2014starred, Booklist</p> <p>\"A page-turning, harrowing, but ultimately empowering tour-de-force...a must read for all humans.\"\u2014I. W. Gregorio, author of None of the Above and This is My Brain in Love</p> \"A tough, powerful, necessary read, especially as Intersex Awareness Day approaches.\"\u2014BuzzFeed</p>",

She promised her parents she would at least try to pretend that she could act like a functioning human this time, not a girl who can\u2019t get out of bed for days on end, who only feels awake when she\u2019s with Sebby.</p><p>Jeremy is the painfully shy art nerd at Saint Francis who\u2019s been in self-imposed isolation after an incident that ruined his last year of school. When he sees Sebby for the first time across the school lawn it\u2019s as if he\u2019s been expecting this blond, lanky boy with a mischief glinting in his eye.</p><p>Sebby, Mira\u2019s gay best friend, is a boy who seems to carry sunlight around with him . Even as life in his foster home starts to take its toll, Sebby and Mira together craft a world of magic rituals and impromptu road trips, designed to fix the broken parts of their lives.</p><p>As Jeremy finds himself drawn into Sebby and Mira\u2019s world, he begins to understand the secrets that they hide in order to protect themselves, to keep each other safe from those who don\u2019t understand their quest to live for the impossible.</p>",

      "description": "<b>UPDATED WITH A NEW EPILOGUE<br></b><br> At fifteen years old, Daphne Scholinski was committed to a mental institution and awarded the dubious diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder. For three years and more than a million dollars of insurance, the problem was \u201ctreated\u201d\u2014with makeup lessons and instructions in how to walk like a girl.<br> \u00a0<br> With a new epilogue by Scholinski, whose name is now Dylan and who identifies as nonbinary, this revised paperback edition of <i>The Last Time I Wore a Dress </i>looks back at those experiences and their life since. It chronicles the journey of coming into oneself and gaining a nuanced, freeing understanding of being born transgender. This memoir tells Dylan Scholinski\u2019s remarkable story in an honest, unforgettable voice that\u2019s both heartbreaking and hopeful.",

They were taken without their families' knowledge to a Civil War-era stockade in Leesburg, Georgia, where they were confined in unsanitary conditions and exposed to brutal treatment. Over the following weeks, their commitment to the fight for equality was put to the test. Combining historical research and personal interviews with several of the girls, Heather E.

Chloe Schwenke was raised as Stephen in a Marine Corps family, and was sent off at age fourteen to \u201cman-up\u201d at a military academy. Later\u2014and still embodied as a man\u2014she ventured abroad to work in some of the roughest regions of Africa, the Gaza Strip, Turkey, and many other locales. Her far-flung global journey was matched in intensity by an inner identity and spiritual struggle and the associated ravages of depression, before she came to the revelation of being a transgender woman.<br><br>At a time when many Americans are just waking up to the reality of the transgender phenomenon, this portrayal of Chloe\u2019s life, her challenging gender transition, and her many accomplishments and adventures along the way (including being among the first three transgender political appointees in U.S. history, under President Obama), creates a poignant story of authenticity, self-discovery, and the meaning of gender set against a fascinating international backdrop.<br><br><b>\u201cTakes the reader through a powerful, heart-wrenching journey of the innumerable, daunting challenges of gender transition confronted by a transgender woman. It is ultimately also a story of extraordinary courage in persevering through formidable odds to be true to oneself. Schwenke underscores the moral, human and societal imperative to confront and ameliorate the challenges faced by transgender people, and others marginalized by mainstream society.\u201d \u2014</b><b>Sanjay Pradhan, CEO, Open Government Partnership</b>",

When Sarah recognized she was a lesbian, she found support from a gay teacher in her high school. Comedian Ellen DeGeneres announced her sexual orientation on national television, and internationally-recognized musician Ricky Martin told the world he was gay on his website. For each individual, the experience of coming out and openly acknowledging oneself as being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender is very different. And it can take a lifetime. Share the personal coming-out experiences of these and other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people to find out more about this complicated and exciting process. Learn about organizations such as gay-straight student alliances and Parents, Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), which provide support to people whose loved ones are coming out. Find out what you can do to help make someone's coming out a positive, happy, and healthy experience.",

Athletes, celebrities, parents, politicians, religious leaders, and even friends can be role models. But many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people don't see people they relate to in their families, schools, or churches. That makes it so much more important to recognize the contributions of the gay and lesbian role models in the forefront of popular culture today. Learn more about some of the most prominent gay and lesbian role models, including late politician Harvey Milk, Bishop Eugene Robinson, Congressman Barney Frank, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, and former NBA player John Amaechi. By taking a stand as leaders in the community, they became role models to LGBT people of all ages around the world.",

But now he's lost his hearing, and the bandleader had to let him go. <p>So Lee goes to a school for the deaf to learn sign language. There, he meets Max, who used to play the sax. Riding the subway to class, they start signing about all the songs they love. A bass player named Rose joins in and soon they've got a little sign language band. And in no time they're performing for audiences in the subway, night after night.</p> <p>Living legend and Kennedy Center honoree Pete Seeger, renowned poet Paul DuBois Jacobs, and Coretta Scott King honor winner R. Gregory Christie present a jazzy riff on the power of music, overcoming obstacles, and all the different ways to hear the world. So, who will listen to a deaf musician? Everyone!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Sydney Taylor Award-winning novel Berlin Boxing Club is loosely inspired by the true story of boxer Max Schmeling's experiences following Kristallnacht. Publishers Weekly called it \"a masterful historical novel\" in a starred review.</p><p>Karl Stern has never thought of himself as a Jew; after all, he's never even been in a synagogue.\u00a0But the bullies at his school in Nazi-era Berlin don't care that Karl's family doesn't practice religion. Demoralized by their attacks\u00a0against a heritage he doesn't accept as his own, Karl longs to prove his worth.</p><p>Then Max Schmeling, champion boxer and German hero, makes a deal with Karl's father to give Karl boxing lessons. A skilled cartoonist, Karl has never had an interest in boxing, but now it seems like the perfect chance to reinvent himself. </p><p>But when Nazi violence against Jews escalates, Karl must take on a new role: family protector. And as Max's fame forces him to associate with Nazi elites, Karl begins to wonder where his hero's sympathies truly lie. Can Karl balance his\u00a0boxing dreams\u00a0with his obligation to keep his family out of harm's way?</p><p>Includes an author's note and sources page detailing the factual inspirations behind the novel. </p>",

Perfect for fans of Holly Jackson and Courtney Summers.</b><br><br><b>Sophie Winters nearly died. Twice. </b><br> \u00a0<br> The first time, she's fourteen, and escapes a near-fatal car accident with scars, a bum leg, and an addiction to Oxy that'll take years to kick.<br> \u00a0<br> The second time, she's seventeen, and it's no accident. Sophie and her best friend Mina are confronted by a masked man in the woods. Sophie survives, but Mina isn\u2019t so lucky. When the cops deem Mina's murder a drug deal gone wrong, casting partial blame on Sophie, no one will believe the truth: Sophie has been clean for months, and it was Mina who led her into the woods that night.<br> \u00a0<br> After a forced stint in rehab, Sophie returns home to a chilly new reality. Mina's brother won't speak to her, her parents fear she'll relapse, old friends have become enemies, and Sophie has to learn how to live without her other half. To make matters worse, no one is looking in the right places and Sophie must search for Mina's murderer on her own.<br> \u00a0<br> But with every step, Sophie comes closer to revealing all: about herself, about Mina\u2014and about the secret they share",

It's Jordan's mom who takes him in when his own mother is on an alcoholic binge; it's Jordan who acts as the brother and role model that Elias doesn't have. But now they've gone too far, and a schoolyard fight has landed them both in jail. The judge gives them a warning: Shape up, or face time in juvie. The clock is already ticking when Jordan gets his girlfriend pregnant and then comes up with a bigtime takedown that'll set them both up for life. For Elias, it's not worth the risk.<br> But can he free himself of Jordan's influence in time? </p>",

While it exhibits the author\u2019s usual storytelling aplomb, it also manages to delve into more serious and timely subject matter, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. Despite these heavy topics, the story still moves at a lively pace and, thanks to a zany sci-fi twist, manages to pack in a few laughs as well.\" \u2014Booklist</p><p>All it takes is one hit on the football field, and suddenly Ash\u2019s life doesn\u2019t look quite the way he remembers it.</p><p>Impossible though it seems, he\u2019s been hit into another dimension\u2014and keeps on bouncing through worlds that are almost-but-not-really his own.</p><p>The changes start small, but they quickly spiral out of control as Ash slides into universes where he has everything he\u2019s ever wanted, universes where society is stuck in the past\u2026universes where he finds himself looking at life through entirely different eyes.</p><p>And if he isn\u2019t careful, the world he\u2019s learning to see more clearly could blink out of existence\u2026</p><p>This high-concept novel from the National Book Award-winning and New York Times-bestselling author of the Arc of a Scythe series tackles the most urgent themes of our time, making this a must-buy for readers who are starting to ask big questions about their own role in the universe.</p>",

It's just as much a part of a Mitchell's life as brewing healing remedies or talking to plants. But Edie, whose pain over losing her mother is still fresh, has no interest in her family's legacy as local \"witches.\"<br><br>When her mother's teenage journal tumbles into her life, her family's mystical inheritance becomes once and for all too hard to ignore. It takes Edie on a scavenger hunt to find objects that once belonged to her mother, each one imbued with a different memory. Every time she touches one of these talismans, it whisks her to another entry inside the journal--where she watches her teenage mom mourn, love, and hope just as Edie herself is now doing.<br><br>But as Edie discovers, there's a dark secret behind her family's practice that she's unwittingly released. She'll have to embrace--and master--the magic she's always rejected...before it consumes her.<br><br>Tinged with a sweet romance with the spellbinding Rhia, who works at the local occult shop, <i>Edie in Between</i> delivers all the cozy magic a budding young witch finding her way in the world needs.",

Some of the kids might be friendly but what about that mean girl who's always picking on you? The author brings up the subjects of childhood trauma, parental substance abuse, kinship care and bullying with a gentle touch suitable for even the youngest children. Tameka's New Dress shines a light on these tough things and lays them out on the table to talk about. He also presents us with a strong girl in Tameka, who not only finds adults who can and do support her, but also finds a way to confront her bullies without becoming a bully herself. Real tips for real life situations are presented here - just what real little children need - a great addition to the library shelves.</p>",

The days as a pirate trainee are long and grueling, but it's not the physical pain that Cas dreads most. It's being forced to work with Swift, the pirate girl who broke her heart. But Cas has even bigger problems when she discovers Boa is not the only a monster swimming free. Other Reckoners illegally sold to pirates have escaped their captors and are taking the NeoPacific by storm, attacking ships at random and ruining the ocean ecosystem. As a Reckoner trainer, Cas might be the only one who can stop them. But how can she take up arms against the creatures she used to care for and protect? Will Cas embrace the murky morals that life as a pirate brings or perish in the dark waters of the NeoPacific? The exciting sequel to The Abyss Surrounds Us",

      "description": "<p>This timely and compelling book conceptualizes Ethnic Studies not only as a vehicle to transform and revitalize the school curriculum but also as a way to reinvent teaching. Drawing on Sleeter\u2019s research review on the impact of Ethnic Studies commissioned by the National Education Association (NEA), the authors show how the traditional curriculum\u2019s Eurocentric view of the world affects diverse student populations. The text highlights several contemporary exemplars of curricula\u2014from classroom level to district or state-wide\u2014illustrating core concepts in Ethnic Studies across a variety of disciplines and grade levels. A final chapter considers how research on P\u201312 ethnic studies can be conceptualized and conducted in ways that further both advocacy and program sustainability. Transformative Ethnic Studies in Schools is essential reading for educators working to transform schools by rehumanizing learning spaces for all students.</p><p>Book Features:</p>Explores how the traditional curriculum is not ideologically neutral and the effect that has on both students of color and White students.Situates Ethnic Studies within anti-racist movements to decolonize schooling.Illustrates the transformative potential of contemporary Ethnic Studies projects. Draws on the insights of Ethnic Studies teachers, researchers, and activists from across the United States.Updates and expands on NEA\u2019s synthesis of the research on the academic and social value of Ethnic Studies.<p>\u201cChristine Sleeter and Miguel Zavala pull no punches in their approach to ethnic studies in education. Despite the negative critiques of ethnic studies rooted in White supremacy and the politics of fear, their contribution to critical thought and praxis is necessary and commendable. Like many of our comrades in this struggle, I rejoice in the fact that they remain undeterred and unafraid.\u201d<br>\u2014David\u00a0Stovall, University of Illinois at Chicago</p>",

For young black men today, it means coming of age during the presidency of Barack Obama. It means witnessing the deaths of Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Akai Gurley, and too many more. It means celebrating powerful moments of black self-determination for LeBron James, Dave Chappelle, and Frank Ocean.<br><br>In Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching, Mychal Denzel Smith chronicles his own personal and political education during these tumultuous years, describing his efforts to come into his own in a world that denied his humanity. Smith unapologetically upends reigning assumptions about black masculinity, rewriting the script for black manhood so that depression and anxiety aren't considered taboo, and feminism and LGBTQ rights become part of the fight. The questions Smith asks in this book are urgent--for him, for the martyrs and the tokens, and for the Trayvons that could have been and are still waiting.<br><br>",

He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, or multiple severe disabilities; with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender. While each of these characteristics is potentially isolating, the experience of difference within families is universal, and Solomon documents triumphs of love over prejudice in every chapter.<br> <br>All parenting turns on a crucial question: to what extent should parents accept their children for who they are, and to what extent they should help them become their best selves. Drawing on ten years of research and interviews with more than three hundred families, Solomon mines the eloquence of ordinary people facing extreme challenges.<br> <br>Elegantly reported by a spectacularly original and compassionate thinker, <i>Far from the Tree</i> explores how people who love each other must struggle to accept each other\u2014a theme in every family\u2019s life.",

While her friends and sister have plunged headfirst into the world of dating and romances, Abby\u2019s been happy to focus on her plus-size style blog and her dreams of taking the fashion industry by storm. When she lands a great internship at her favorite boutique, she\u2019s thrilled to take the first step toward her dream career. Then she falls for her fellow intern, Jordi Perez. Hard. And now she\u2019s competing against the girl she\u2019s kissing to win the coveted paid job at the end of the internship.<br><br> But really, nothing this summer is going as planned. She also unwittingly becomes friends with Jax, a lacrosseplaying bro-type who wants her help finding the best burger in Los Angeles, and she\u2019s struggling to prove to her mother\u2014the city\u2019s celebrity health nut\u2014that she\u2019s perfectly content with who she is.<br><br> Just as Abby starts to feel like she\u2019s no longer the sidekick in her own life, Jordi\u2019s photography surprisingly puts her in the spotlight. Instead of feeling like she\u2019s landed a starring role, Abby feels betrayed. Can Abby find a way to reconcile her positive yet private sense of self with the image others have of her?",

To make matters worse, on the day his school bans hats (his preferred camouflage), Dylan goes up on his roof only to fall and wake up in the hospital with a broken leg--and a mandate to attend group therapy for self-harmers. <br> <br> Dylan vows to say nothing and zones out at therapy--until he meets Jamie. She's funny, smart, and so stunning, even his womanizing best friend, JP, would be jealous. She's also the first person to ever call Dylan out on his self-pitying and superficiality.<br> <br> As Jamie's humanity and wisdom begin to rub off on Dylan, they become more than just friends. But there is something Dylan doesn't know about Jamie, something she shared with the group the day he wasn't listening. Something that shouldn't change a thing. She is who she's always been--an amazing photographer and devoted friend, who also happens to be transgender. But will Dylan see it that way?<br> <br> Praise for <i>Beast:</i><br> \"Writing smartly in Dylan's voice, Spangler artfully represents both main characters: the boy who feels like a freak and the witty, imperfect, wise trans girl he loves. Very lightly borrowing on the classic fairy tale, she allows them to fail and succeed without resorting to paper villains or violent plot points to manipulate compassion. A believable and beautiful human story.\" --<i>Kirkus Reviews,</i> Starred review<br> <br> \"Spangler's captivating portrayals of Dylan and Jamie offer piercing insight into the long, painful battle to shatter stereotypes in order to win dignity, love, and acceptance.\" --<i>Publishers Weekly,</i> Starred review",

      "description": "<p>Based on extensive research, this provocative volume explores how schools are places where racial conflicts often remain hidden at the expense of a healthy school climate and the well-being of students of color. Most schools fail to act on racial microaggressions because the stress of negotiating such conflicts is extremely high due to fears of incompetence, public exposure, and accusation. Instead of facing these conflicts head on, schools perpetuate a set of avoidance or coping strategies. The author of this much-needed book uncovers how racial stress undermines student achievement. Students, educators, and social service support staff will find workable strategies to improve their racial literacy skills to read, recast, and resolve racially stressful encounters when they happen.</p><p>Book Features:</p> A model that applies culturally relevant behavioral stress management strategies to problem solve racial stress in schools. Examples demonstrating workable solutions relevant within predominantly White schools for students, parents, teachers, and administrators. Measurable outcomes and strategies for developing racial literacy skills that can be integrated into the K\u201312 curriculum and teacher professional development. Teaching and leadership skills that will create a more tolerant and supportive school environment for all students.<p>\u201cOnce more, Howard Stevenson has provided a blueprint of critical importance to policymakers, practitioners, teachers, and parents!\u201d<br>\u2014Margaret\u00a0Beale\u00a0Spencer, Marshall Field IV Professor of Urban Education and professor of Life Course Human Development, University of Chicago</p><p>Howard C.

Derek has to choose whether to risk telling the truth or to give up the most important relationship in his life.</p> <p>This short novel is a high-interest, low-reading level book for teen readers who are building reading skills, want a quick read or say they don\u2019t like to read!

There she met a professor named Pierre Curie, and the two soon married, forming one of the most famous scientific partnerships in history. Together they discovered two elements and won a Nobel Prize in 1903. (Later Marie won another Nobel award for chemistry in 1911.) She died in Savoy, France, on July 4, 1934, a victim of many years of exposure to toxic radiation.",

Offering important lessons about how to remain accountable to  communities while designing a curriculum with a social justice agenda, Stovall explores  the use of critical race theory to encourage its practitioners to spend less  time with abstract theories and engage more with communities that make a  concerted effort to change their conditions. Stovall provides concrete examples  of how to navigate the constraints of working with centralized bureaucracies in  education and apply them to real-world situations.",

The compelling story ranges over the whole of Nat's Life, reaching its inevitable and shattering climax that bloody day in August. <br><br> <b>The Confessions of Nat Turner</b> is not only a masterpiece of storytelling; is also reveals in unforgettable human terms the agonizing essence of Negro slavery. Through the mind of a slave, Willie Styron has re-created a catastrophic event, and dramatized the intermingled miseries, frustrations--and hopes--which caused this extraordinary black man to rise up out of the early mists of our history and strike down those who held his people in bondage.",

Some are small, like how it bothers her when her friends don\u2019t invite her to parties. Some are big, like the fact that\u00a0her father may be having an affair. And then there\u2019s the one that she can barely even admit to\u00a0herself\u2014the\u00a0one about how she might have a crush on her best friend.<br><br>When Sana and her family move to California, she begins to wonder if it\u2019s finally time for\u00a0some honesty, especially after she meets Jamie Ramirez. Jamie is beautiful and smart and unlike anyone Sana\u2019s ever known.</p><p>There are just a few problems: Sana's new\u00a0friends don't trust Jamie's crowd; Jamie's friends clearly don't want her around anyway; and a sweet guy named Caleb seems to have more-than-friendly feelings for her. Meanwhile, her dad\u2019s affair is becoming too obvious to ignore.<br><br>Sana always figured that the hardest thing would be to tell people that she wants to date a girl, but as she quickly learns, telling the truth is easy\u2026what comes after it, though, is a whole lot more complicated.</p>",

In this hair-positivity book, children will meet Lola. Lola has really big curly hair, much bigger than the other kids at her school. While her big hair leads to lots of stares, ruins her games of hide and seek, and makes her easy to spot in a crowd, Lola embraces her differences and keeps kids entertained with the book's catchy refrain &quot;I've got big hair and I don't care!&quot;",

But long before he braved new frontiers in Star Trek, he woke up as a four-year-old boy to find his own birth country at war with his father's--and their entire family forced from their home into an uncertain future. In a stunning graphic memoir, Takei revisits his haunting childhood in American concentration camps, as one of over 100,000 Japanese Americans imprisoned by the U.S. government during World War II. Experience the forces that shaped an American icon--and America itself--in this gripping tale of courage, country, loyalty, and love.",

      "description": "<p>Perfect for fans of Becky Albertalli and Nina LaCour, this romantic comedy from New York Times bestselling author Robin Talley has something for everyone: backstage rendezvous, deadly props, and a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to True Love.</p><p>Melody McIntyre, stage manager extraordinaire, has a plan for everything.</p><p>What she doesn\u2019t have? Success with love. Every time she falls for someone during a school performance, both the romance and the show end in catastrophe. So, Mel swears off any entanglements until their upcoming production of Les Mis is over.</p><p>Of course, Mel didn\u2019t count on Odile Rose, rising star in the acting world, auditioning for the spring performance. And she definitely didn\u2019t expect Odile to be sweet and funny, and care as much about the play\u2019s success as Mel.</p><p>Which means that Melody McIntyre\u2019s only plan now is trying desperately not to fall in love.</p>",

Tatum\u2019s unique ability to get people talking about race captured the attention of many, from Oprah Winfrey to President Clinton, who invited her to join him in his nationally televised dialogues on race.<br><br>In her first book since that pathbreaking success, Tatum starts with a warning call about the increasing but underreported resegregation of America. A selfdescribed \u201cintegration baby\u201c\u2014she was born in 1954\u2014Tatum sees our growing isolation from each other as deeply problematic, and she believes that schools can be key institutions for forging connections across the racial divide.<br><br>In this ambitious, accessible book, Tatum examines some of the most resonant issues in American education and race relations: <br><br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0The need of African American students to see themselves reflected in curricula and institutions<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0How unexamined racial attitudes can negatively affect minority-student achievement<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0The possibilities\u2014and complications\u2014of intimate crossracial friendships<br>Tatum approaches all these topics with the blend of analysis and storytelling that make her one of our most persuasive and engaging commentators on race.<br><br><i>Can We Talk About Race?</i> launches a collaborative lecture and book series between Beacon Press and Simmons College, which aims to reinvigorate a crucial national public conversation on race, education and democracy.",

He didn\u2019t have a bat. He didn\u2019t have a ball. And there wasn\u2019t a single black ball player in the major leagues. B ut none of this could stop Henry Aaron.

      "description": "<b>The dark story of the shocking resurgence of white supremacist and nationalist groups, and their path to political power</b><br><br> Six years ago, Vegas Tenold embedded himself among the members of three of America's most ideologically extreme white nationalist groups-the KKK, the National Socialist Movement, and the Traditionalist Workers Party. At the time, these groups were part of a disorganized counterculture that felt far from the mainstream.<br><br> But since then, all that has changed. Racially-motivated violence has been on open display at rallies in Charlottesville, Berkeley, Pikesville, Phoenix, and Boston. Membership in white nationalist organizations is rising, and national politicians, including the president, are validating their perceived grievances.<br><br><i>Everything You Love Will Burn</i> offers a terrifying, sobering inside look at these newly empowered movements, from their conventions to backroom meetings with Republican operatives. Tenold introduces us to neo-Nazis in Brooklyn; a millennial Klanswoman in Tennessee; and a rising star in the movement, nicknamed the \"Little F\u00fc by the Southern Poverty Law Center, who understands political power and is organizing a grand coalition of far-right groups to bring them into the mainstream.<br><br><i>Everything You Love Will Burn </i>takes readers to the dark, paranoid underbelly of America, a world in which the white race is under threat and the enemy is everywhere.",

In response, the girl's mother teaches her about the musicality of African, Asian, Black-American, Latinx, and Middle Eastern names on their lyrical walk home through the city. Empowered by this newfound understanding, the young girl is ready to return the next day to share her knowledge with her class. Your Name is a Song is a celebration to remind all of us about the beauty, history, and magic behind names. <p> <p><i>Your Name is a Song</i> includes back matter perfect for parents, educators, caregivers, and young readers who want to learn more about the names featured in the story. The \"Glossary of Names\" lists each name's meaning, origin, and pronunciation. Additionally, readers can use a listed link to access an online video of the author pronouncing all the names in the book.</p>",

She never wanted to be invisible in her own family, she never wanted to crush on her best friend Alyssa, and she definitely never wanted to know how effectively a mallet could destroy someone's head. But the universe doesn't care what she wants. Shane Mayfield doesn't care what Seelie wants either. When the former high school basketball star attacks her, she has no choice but to defend herself. She saved her own life, but she can't bring herself to talk about what happened that night. Not all of it. Not even when she's arrested for murder.",

Though born in the United States, Luz often faced prejudice because of his Mexican heritage. Determined to help his community, even in the face of discrimination, he taught school\u2014children during the day and adults in the evenings.<br> <br> When World War I broke out, Luz joined the army, as did many others. His ability to quickly learn languages made him an invaluable member of the Intelligence Office in Europe. However, Luz found that prejudice followed him even to war, and despite his efforts, he often didn\u2019t receive credit for his contributions. Upon returning home to Texas, he joined with other Mexican American veterans to create the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), which today is the largest and oldest Latinx civil rights organization.<br> <br> Using his signature illustration style and Luz\u2019s diary entries from the war, award-winning author and illustrator Duncan Tonatiuh tells the story of a Mexican American war hero and his fight for equality. </p>",

One day Pa comes home with a gift from his civil rights group: a typewriter. Thrilled with the present, Mason spends all his spare time teaching himself to type. Soon he knows where every letter on the keyboard is located.</p> <p>When the civil rights group wins a school desegregation case, Mason learns that now he will be attending a formerly all-white high school. Despite his fears and injustice from the students and faculty, Mason perseveres. He does well in school-especially in his typing class. And when he competes in the county typing tournament, Mason decides to take a stand, using his skills to triumph over prejudice and break racial barriers.</p> <p>Winner of Lee & Low's New Voices Award, <i>As Fast As Words Could Fly</i> is an inspiring testament to the power of hard work, determination, and belief in yourself to overcome life's challenges.</p>",

      "description": "<b>From Carnegie Medal finalist Jenny Valentine comes a bold new story about the boundlessness of love and second chances, perfect for fans of David Levithan's <i>Every Day</i>.</b><br><br>Jude doesn't believe in love, or magic. Life is little more than ordinary. That is, until Jude's mother loses her job and moves them to a little town by the sea to live with Henry Lake--an eccentric old man with rooms to rent. Henry is odd, the town is dull, and worst of all, Jude feels out of place and alone.<br><br>So when Novo turns up in the house across the street, dressed all in black and looking unbearably handsome, Jude's summer takes an immediate turn for the better. But Novo isn't all that he seems to be--or maybe he's more than Jude can possibly understand. Novo is pure magic--someone who can bend and stretch the bounds of time. Someone who wakes up in different places and at different points in history with utter regularity. He knows that each Now is fleeting, that each moment is only worth the energy it expends on itself, and that each experience he has will be lost to him before long. <br><br>But Jude and Novo form a bond that shifts reality for both of them. Jude begins to question what forever really means--only to find out that Novo knows that forever isn't real. And when things go horribly wrong, Jude and Novo are faced with an impossible question that may change both of their lives irreparably--what is worth sacrificing for love?<br><br>A stunningly written, compelling exploration of the universality of love--and what it means to live in the moment--that quite literally defies both logic and time. A love story without borders that reflects the best of our modern world.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Hello Now</i>:</b><br><br>* \"Babbitt's <i>Tuck Everlasting</i> revisioned as a passionate YA love story, this is an exquisitely told romantic fantasy, golden yet lacerating.\" --<i>BCCB</i>, STARRED REVIEW",

Valenzuela argues that schools subtract resources from youth in two major ways: firstly by dismissing their definition of education and secondly, through assimilationist policies and practices that minimize their culture and language. A key consequence is the erosion of students\u0092 social capital evident in the absence of academically oriented networks among acculturated, U.S.-born youth.",

The Grizzly, Beaver, Frog, and Raven all stretch and scratch and voice their relief at being free at last. But then the first dawn light appears on the horizon, and the totems have to reassemble themselves in the proper order before morning. Who should be on top of whom? Can wise Raven reason with these contentious creatures? Deb Vanasse\u2019s enchanting text and Erik Brooks\u2019s lively illustrations make this a memorable modern folktale.",

      "description": "Fourteen-year-old Susan (or, as she prefers to be called, Sybil) has been trying to reinvent herself ever since the mysterious disappearance of her older sister, Alison. Life has been very confusing since Alison left. Susan s mother has become overly protective, fearful of losing another child. Her new school is not all bad, of course, but it is different and puzzling. Her best friend, Connie, has what could be a wonderful idea or maybe it has the makings of a disaster: if they sign up for the school play, they might end up with dates for the freshman dance.<br> Readers will empathize with Susan s attempt to make sense of her confused world, the loss of her sister, a new school, turmoil at home, and the growing pains of adolescence. But Susan, despite all, remains bright, funny, and self aware with the help of a new and intelligently supportive stepfather and a lively group of school friends. The story is believable and touching and distinguished by the narrator s voice.<br>\"",

      "description": "Our Favorite African Adrinkra Symbols is a coloring book with drawings of the Symbols, poems for each of the Seven Principles of the Nguzo Saba, and Learning Activities for children and adults.To Our Children's Parents and Teachers Symbology is a sacred aspect of African culture, spirituality and art, and this is reflected in the traditional African system of educating/parenting. Children grow up learning through the use and understanding of relationships, analogies, harmonies and symbolic imagery and as a result, their creative genius and intuition (an important aspect of African intelligence) are stimulated and developed. At the African Learning Center, we use symbols from the entire African continent, and we have been inspired especially by the Adinkra symbols of Ghana. They are an integral part of our character-building program which helps children relate to each other, and their elders. Adinkra is a type of cloth which was originally woven on narrow looms by the Akan people of Ghana. The word Adinkra means \"farewell or good-bye\" and traditionally the cloth was worn at funerals in honor of the departed ones and to encourage them on the path of spiritual development. The symbols, which were stamped into the cloth, contained messages which included names of historical events and persons, proverbs, familiar objects and cultural concepts. Today, Adinkra cloth is worn for a variety of special occasions including weddings, birthday celebrations, and naming ceremonies. Our children internalize and utilize the sixty symbols included in the pamphlet, The Language of Adinkra Patterns, by A.K. Quarcoo, 1972. We have chosen seventeen for this coloring book. The literal translations and explanations from the pamphlet are included as well as poems reflecting not only the symbols, but also their relationship to the Nguzo Saba, the Seven Principles of Blackness; Umoja - Unity; Kujiamulia - Self-Determination; Ujima - Collective Work and Responsibility; Ujamaa - Cooperative Economics; Nia - Purpose; Uumbaji - Creativity; and lmani - Faith. The Nguzo Saba was developed by Dr. Maulana Ron Karenga based on his study of African culture and the value system of traditional African society. These principles form the foundation of Kwanzaa, the increasingly popular holiday among Africans in America, which is celebrated from December 26 to January 1. Kwanzaa was started by Dr. Karenga in 1966 and has its roots in the traditional African celebrations of the harvest and the fruits of communal labor. These celebrations were times of thanksgiving and purification; of ritualization, revitalization, and regeneration. The Nguzo Saba and the Adinkra symbols, reflections of the wisdom of our ancestors, give us direction throughout the year. Today, the Adinkra symbols inspire us to be strong and positive. Their wisdom, optimism, faith and love engender within us a deep appreciation of Africa, and the humanity and spiritual depth of African people. Peace and Love, Abena Walker, Director The African Learning Center",

A<i> software tester, workplace jester, cherished mentor, ace inventor, avid reader, naval leader\u2014</i>AND <i>rule breaker, chance taker, and troublemaker. </i>Acclaimed picture book author Laurie Wallmark (<i>Ada Byron Lovelace and the Thinking Machine</i>) once again tells the riveting story of a trailblazing woman. Grace Hopper coined the term \u201ccomputer bug\u201d and taught computers to \u201cspeak English.\u201d Throughout her life, Hopper succeeded in doing what no one had ever done before. Delighting in difficult ideas and in defying expectations, the insatiably curious Hopper truly was \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d . . . and a role model for science- and math-minded girls and boys. With a wealth of witty quotes, and richly detailed illustrations, this book brings Hopper's incredible accomplishments to life.",

She wants to forget it ever happened, but David needs her to be his alibi--and is willing to destroy her family if she refuses. Trapped, Leda must choose between the truth, her boyfriend, and her family.</p><p>Jonathan Tanner-Eales feels like an outsider. He's gay, and life in rural Vermont hasn't been as idyllic as he hoped it would be. When Jonathan and his boyfriend, Ricky, are attacked during a night swim, Jonathan manages to escape, but must watch, helpless, as Ricky is beaten. Jonathan, plagued by trauma and fear, wrestles with anger and shame in the aftermath of the crime.</p><p>That summer Leda and Jonathan are swept together by chance, and both must reckon with fundamental questions of loyalty and courage. What does it mean to speak the truth when a lie protects the ones you love? Will Leda put the fate of her family and her boyfriend first, or can Jonathan persuade her to tell the truth?</p>",

Performing catapulted her all the way to the stages of 1920s Broadway where she inspired everyone from songwriters to playwrights. Yet with all her success, she knew firsthand how prejudice shaped her world and the world of those around her. As a result, Florence chose to support and promote works by her fellow black performers while heralding a call for their civil rights. Featuring a moving text and colorful illustrations, <i>Harlem's Little Blackbird</i> is a timeless story about justice, equality, and the importance of following one's heart and dreams.<br><br><br>A CARTER G. WOODSON ELEMENTARY HONOR BOOK<br>(awarded by the National Council for the Social Studies, 2013)",

Her mother tells her to take advantage of every opportunity that comes her way. And Jade has: every day she rides the bus to the private school where she feels like an outsider, but where she has plenty of opportunities. But some <i>opportunities</i> she doesn't really welcome, like an invitation to join a mentorship program for \"at-risk\" girls. Just because her mentor is Black and graduated from the same high school doesn't mean she understands where Jade is coming from. She's tired of being singled out as someone who needs help, someone people want to fix. Jade wants to speak, to create, to express her joys and sorrows, her pain and her hope. Maybe there are some things she could show other women about understanding the world and finding ways to be real, to make a difference.<br><br> <b><i>NPR's </i>Best Books </b><b><br> A New York Public Library Best Teen Book of the Year<br> Chicago Public Library's Best Books </b><br> <b>A <i>School Library Journal </i>Best Book </b><br> <b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i>' Best Teen Books </b><br> <b>Josette Frank Award Winner</b></p>",

And there was a lot to hear, growing up in the south during the 1930s: church songs, preachers praying, music on the radio, and the bustling of the household. John was surrounded by all kinds of vivid noises that shaped his own sound as a musician. With vibrant words and glowing colors, Carole Boston Weatherford and Sean Qualls compose an amazingly rich hymn to the childhood of jazz legend John Coltrane.<br><br><i>Before John Was a Jazz Giant</i> is a 2009 Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor Book and a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p>",

Here they were free to set up an open market, sing, dance, and play music. They were free to forget their cares, their struggles, and their oppression. This story chronicles slaves' duties each day, from chopping logs on Mondays to baking bread on Wednesdays to plucking hens on Saturday, and builds to the freedom of Sundays and the special experience of an afternoon spent in Congo Square. This book includes a forward from Freddi Williams Evans (freddievans.com), a historian and Congo Square expert, as well as a glossary of terms with pronunciations and definitions.",

When he bought a camera, his life changed forever. He taught himself how to take pictures and before long, people noticed. His success as a fashion photographer landed him a job working for the government. In Washington DC, Gordon went looking for a subject, but what he found was segregation. He and others were treated differently because of the color of their skin. Gordon wanted to take a stand against the racism he observed. With his camera in hand, he found a way. Told through lyrical verse and atmospheric art, this is the story of how, with a single photograph, a self-taught artist got America to take notice.</p>",

Thirteen-year-old AnnMarie Walker dreams of a world beyond Far Rockaway, where the sway of the neighborhood keeps her tied to old ideas about success. While attending a school for pregnant teens, AnnMarie comes across a flyer advertising movie auditions in Manhattan. Astonishingly, improbably, and four months before she\u2019s due to give birth\u2014she lands a lead role. For a time, AnnMarie soars\u2014acting for the camera, flying to the Sundance Film Festival, seeing her face on-screen. But when the film fades from view and the realities of her life set in, AnnMarie\u2019s grit and determination are the only tools left to keep her moving forward.</p><p>Told with remarkable compassion and based on the real-life story of Anna Simpson, whom the author met during the filming of the award-winning <i>Our Song</i>, Hannah Weyer\u2019s debut novel is an incredible act of literary ventriloquism that powerfully illuminates the lives of the urban unseen.<br><br></p>",

      "description": "<b>A provocative book about rethinking hatred and violence in America</b><br> \u00a0<br>Over the centuries American society has been plagued by brutality fueled by disregard for the humanity of others: systemic violence against Native peoples, black people, and immigrants. More recent examples include the Steubenville rape case and the murders of Matthew Shepard, Jennifer Daugherty, Marcelo Lucero, and Trayvon Martin. Most Americans see such acts as driven by hate. But is this right? Longtime activists and political theorists Kay Whitlock and Michael Bronski boldly assert that American society\u2019s reliance on the framework of hate to explain these acts is wrongheaded, misleading, and ultimately harmful.<br><br> All too often Americans choose to believe that terrible cruelty is aberrant, caused primarily by \u201cextremists\u201d and misfits. The inevitable remedy of intensified government-based policing, increased surveillance, and harsher punishments has never worked and does not work now. Stand-your-ground laws; the US prison system; police harassment of people of color, women, and LGBT people; and the so-called war on terror demonstrate that the remedies themselves are forms of institutionalized violence.<br><br> <i>Considering Hate</i> challenges easy assumptions and failed solutions, arguing that \u201chate violence\u201d reflects existing cultural norms. Drawing upon social science, philosophy, theology, film, and literature, the authors examine how hate and common, even ordinary, forms of individual and group violence are excused and normalized in popular culture and political discussion. This massive denial of brutal reality profoundly warps society\u2019s ideas about goodness and justice.<br><br>Whitlock and Bronski invite readers to radically reimagine the meaning and structures of justice within a new framework of community wholeness, collective responsibility, and civic goodness.",

      "description": "When relief workers bring used clothing to the refugee camp, everyone scrambles to grab whatever they can. Ten-year-old Lina is thrilled when she finds a sandal that fits her foot perfectly, until she sees that another girl has the matching shoe. But soon Lina and Feroza meet and decide that it is better to share the sandals than for each to wear only one. As the girls go about their routines washing clothes in the river, waiting in long lines for water, and watching for their names to appear on the list to go to America the sandals remind them that frie ndship is what is most important. Four Feet, Two Sandals was inspired by a refugee girl who asked the authors why there were no books about children like her. With warm colors and sensitive brush strokes, this book portrays the strength, courage, and hope of refugees around the world, whose daily existence is marked by uncertainty and fear.",

      "description": "What does it mean to be male? What does it mean to be female? In contemporary culture, such distinctions have increasingly been regarded as much too narrow to cover the entire spectrum of humanity. Over the past few decades, thousands of individuals have bravely declared their true identities and refused to be boxed into what society has dictated. It has become increasingly important, especially for those coming into adulthood, to go beyond the concepts of gay, lesbian, straight, and bisexual when examining gender.<br><br>In Gender Identity: The Ultimate Teen Guide, Cynthia L. Winfield encourages readers to reject the notion that male or female designations fit all. The author examines how gender lines have been crossed as a growing number of individuals\u2014including young adults\u2014have found the courage to express and celebrate their authentic selves. In this book, Winfield addresses:<br><br><ul><li>Differences between biological sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression</li><li>Legal protections for those outside the narrowly defined gender norms</li><li>Public debate and shifting views about gender identity</li><li>Ways readers can make society more cognizant and inclusive of gender-variant individuals</li></ul><br>In addition to providing a well-grounded introduction to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual persons and issues, this book allows contemporary teens and young adults to voice their experiences. As more and more public figures\u2014from actress Laverne Cox to Olympic athlete turned reality television star Caitlyn Jenner\u2014have shared their stories, it\u2019s just as important for everyday people to identify who they are. This second edition of Gender Identity: The Ultimate Teen Guide is a much-needed update of an important topic and will be of interest to young adults, their families and friends, and the community at large.",

      "description": "Adulting is hard. Just ask Wes Hudson. An avid comic book geek, Wes excels at two things: slacking off and pining after his best friend, Nico. Advice from his friends, '90s alt-rock songs, and online dating articles aren't helping much with his secret crush. And his dream job at Once Upon a Page, the local indie bookstore, is threatened when a coffee shop franchise wants to buy the property. To top it off, his family won't stop pestering him about picking a college major. When all three problems converge, Wes must face the one thing he's been avoiding--adulthood.",

Grady is happy about his decision to finally be true to himself, despite the practical complications, like which gym locker room to use. And though he didn\u2019t expect his family and friends to be happy about his decision, he also didn\u2019t expect kids at school to be downright nasty about it. But as the victim of some cruel jokes, Grady also finds unexpected allies in this thought-provoking novel that explores struggles any reader can relate to.",

      "description": "This great guide is a much-needed way to introduce young readers to the gender galaxy. Readers will become familiar with some of the many gender identities a person can have, such as trans man, trans woman, gender fluid, bigender, or two-spirit. They\u2019ll learn about bodies beyond the gender binary, as well as the differences between gender expression, gender identity, and sexuality. A chapter on transphobia and cissexism acknowledges the discrimination and mistreatment that trans people face, but the support that trans communities can provide is also emphasized. Perfect for both transgender teens and young trans allies.",

As a charming, talented pro football star, he's as beloved to the neighborhood kids he plays with as he is to his millions of adoring sports fans. But lately life at ZJ's house is anything but charming. His dad is having trouble remembering things and seems to be angry all the time. ZJ's mom explains it's because of all the head injuries his dad sustained during his career. ZJ can understand that--but it doesn't make the sting any less real when his own father forgets his name. As ZJ contemplates his new reality, he has to figure out how to hold on tight to family traditions and recollections of the glory days, all the while wondering what their past amounts to if his father can't remember it. And most importantly, can those happy feelings ever be reclaimed when they are all so busy aching for the past?",

In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child\u2019s soul as she searches for her place in the world.

With its powerful anti-bullying message and striking art, it will resonate with readers long after they've put it down.<br><br> Chloe and her friends won't play with the new girl, Maya. Every time Maya tries to join Chloe and her friends, they reject her. Eventually Maya stops coming to school. When Chloe's teacher gives a lesson about how even small acts of kindness can change the world, Chloe is stung by the lost opportunity for friendship, and thinks about how much better it could have been if she'd shown a little kindness toward Maya.",

Maybe it's how you look or talk, or where you're from; maybe it's what you eat, or something just as random. It's not easy to take those first steps into a place where nobody really knows you yet, but somehow you do it. <br><br>Jacqueline Woodson's lyrical text and Rafael L\u00f3pez's dazzling art reminds us that we all feel like outsiders sometimes-and how brave it is that we go forth anyway. And that sometimes, when we reach out and begin to share our stories, others will be happy to meet us halfway.<br><br>(This book is also available in Spanish, as <i>El D\u00eda En Que Descubres Qui\u00e9n Eres</i>!)",

She is much-published author in Australia.</p><p><b>Joseph Cowman</b> lives and paints in the hills and valleys of suburban Idaho.

Though Dad moves around a lot and his jobs keep changing, a young girl and her brother hold fast to memories of his magical, unexpected visits in this portrait of an African-American family held together by a special bond of love. \"This poignant, lyrical story captures the games children play; the anticipation and pleasure of seeing a mostly absent, yet loving parent; and the reality of having no control over what adults do, of never knowing what might happen next, and of parting. Regardless of circumstances, somehow it's always clear to this patient, wise-for-her-years girl that her father loves her. The etched watercolor, charcoal, colored-pencil, and lithograph-pencil art has a dreamy, statuesque quality.\" --\"School Library Journal",

Along with hundreds of other workers, the brothers are going to build a great railroad across the West.

She would use it to make everyone happy, to erase the smell of garbage from her city, to sleep an extra hour in the morning.

And even if she never found a magic pencil, Malala realized that she could still work hard every day to make her wishes come true.<br><br> This beautifully illustrated volume tells Malala's story for a younger audience and shows them the worldview that allowed Malala to hold on to hope even in the most difficult of times.<br><br> \"This is a wonderful read for younger students that will also provide insight and encourage discussion about the wider world. ...
