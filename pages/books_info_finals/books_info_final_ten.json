More than fifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the birth of Black Power, the United States has had a black president and black CEOs running Fortune 500 companies\u2014as well as a large black underclass beset by persistent poverty, inadequate education, and an epidemic of incarceration. Harvard professor and scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. raises disturbing and vital questions about this dichotomy. How did the African American community end up encompassing such profound contradictions? And what will \u201cthe black community\u201d mean tomorrow?<br><br>Gates takes readers through the major historical events and untold stories of the years that have irrevocably shaped both the African American experience and the nation as a whole, from the explosive social and political changes of the 1960s into the 1970s and 1980s\u2014eras characterized by both prosperity and neglect\u2014through the turn of the century to today, taking measure of such racial flashpoints as the Tawana Brawley case, OJ Simpson\u2019s murder trial, the murders of Amadou Diallo and Trayvon Martin, and debates around the NYPD\u2019s \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies. Even as it surveys the political and social evolution of black America, <i>And Still I Rise</i> is also a celebration of the accomplishments of black artists, musicians, writers, comedians, and thinkers who have helped to define American popular culture and to change our world.<br><br>\u201cThe chronology is richly illustrated with images both iconic and seldom seen, making this especially useful as a visual reference for readers too young to have scenes from the early years burned into their memories. . . . a poignant reminder of how far we have come\u2014and have yet to go.\u201d \u2014<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>",

Keum Suk Gendry-Kim emphasizes Lee\u2019s strength in overcoming the many forms of adversity she experienced. <i>Grass</i> is painted in a black ink that flows with lavish details of the beautiful fields and farmland of Korea and uses heavy brushwork on the somber interiors of Lee\u2019s memories. <br><br>The cartoonist Gendry-Kim\u2019s interviews with Lee become an integral part of <i>Grass</i>, forming the heart and architecture of this powerful nonfiction graphic novel and offering a holistic view of how Lee\u2019s wartime suffering changed her. <i>Grass</i> is a landmark graphic novel that makes personal the desperate cost of war and the importance of peace.</p>",

Really hard, because it is made up; it's a way that humans have developed over the millennia to simplify how we see and interact with our complex and messy world and to classify and categorize all the people in it. The concept of gender has changed over time and not everyone agrees on the ways gender works or how to define it. But individuals alone are the ones who gets to determine for themselves what gender means and how to live it. </p><p> Trans+ answers hard questions about gender expression and identity; covers mental health and wellness as well as developing bodies and reproduction; transitioning medically, socially, and legally; healthy vs. unhealthy relationships; sex and pleasure; and life as a trans or nonbinary individual. It's full of essential information teens need--and want--and includes up close and personal stories from the authors and trans youth, evocatively relating their own experiences of love, sex, romance, and just being their wonderful selves. </p><p>But perhaps most importantly, Trans+ will remind readers that no matter where they may live and who they are, transgender and non-binary people have often held a revered place in their societies as shamans, healer, leaders, and esteemed rulers. And just like their ancestors, they are perfect, whole and complete beings, no less than the stars and stardust covering the entire universe.</p>",

Mother's Day is coming soon, and Antonio searches for the words to express his love for his mother and her partner, Leslie. But he's not sure what to do when his classmates make fun of Leslie, an artist, who towers over everyone and wears paint-splattered overalls. As Mother's Day approaches, Antonio must choose whether - or how - to express his connection to both of the special women in his life.</p> <p>Rigoberto Gonz\u00e1lez's bilingual story about a nontraditional family resonates with all children who have been faced with speaking up for themselves or for the people they love.

Could they be onto something?<br><br>Everyone assumes that Art is gay. They take one look at his nice clothes and his pretty face and think: <i>well, obviously</i>. <br><br>But there\u2019s more to Zee and Art than anyone realizes. What develops is a powerful connection between two people who are beautiful in all the ways they've been told are strange. As they explore their own complex relationships to gender, sexuality, and identity, they fall for the complexities they find in each other. With his trademark frankness, B. T. Gottfred delves inside both characters' heads in this story about love and living authentically.</p>",

Although everyone shuns the Ortiz-Woodleys, the mysterious Logan may be the only person who can help Ashley get some answers. <br><br>When Ashley and Logan team up to figure out who\u2014or what\u2014is haunting Snakebite, their investigation reveals truths about the town, their families, and themselves that neither of them are ready for.

      "description": "Visually amazing, this critical history of comic books, manga, and graphic novels is a must-have for any comic buff or collector.\u00a0 Over the centuries, comic books and their offshoots, such as graphic novels, manga, and bandes dessin\u00e9es, have evolved into a phenomenally popular, influential, and unique art form with which we can express our opinions, our fantasies, our nightmares, and our dreams. In short: comics are emphatically no longer just for kids. This diverse, constantly evolving medium is truly coming into its own in the 21st century, from Hollywood's blockbuster adaptations of super-powered caped crusaders to the global spread of Japan's manga and its spinoffs, and from award-winning graphic novels such as <i>Maus</i> and <i>Persepolis</i> to new forms such as online webcomix. This volume is the perfect introduction to a dynamic and globally popular medium, embracing every graphic genre worldwide to assess the very best works of sequential art, graphic literature, comics, and comic strips, past and present.<br>An international survey, this engaging volume is organized according to the year of first publication in the country of origin. An opening section acknowledges pioneering pre-1900 masterpieces, followed by sections divided by decade, creating a fascinating year-by-year chronicle of the graphic medium worldwide. The material includes the very earliest one-off albums to the latest in online comics and features some series and characters that have run for decades. <br>Packed with fantastic reproductions of classic front covers and groundbreaking panels, this book is visually stunning as well as a trove of information--perfect for the\u00a0passionate collector and\u00a0casual fan alike.",

His father will no longer be coaching the travel baseball team and is moving to Florida, forcing his mom and little sister to move into a small apartment on the wrong side of town. To make matters worse, the new coach of the travel team is an unforgiving drill sergeant.</p><p>But then Benji tells Josh of a home-run derby in which the winner gets a brand-new house. All Josh has to do to qualify is hit twenty home runs during his travel-team season. With Benji and Jaden's help, Josh is hoping to hit it out of the park and save his family, because if he strikes out, he may just lose everything.</p>",

      "description": "<p>In a career that spanned much of the twentieth century, Hungarian-born photographer Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz (1894-1985) created deceptively simple yet compelling and poetic photographs. This book presents approximately 120 of these striking images as well as previously unpublished archival material that sheds important light on the artist and his work.</p> <br> <br> <p>Like the exhibition it accompanies, <i>Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz</i> takes us through Kert\u00e9sz's years in Budapest, Paris, and New York. Unlike other works on Kert\u00e9sz, it presents only vintage prints and includes several seldom seen photographs from throughout his career.</p> <br> <br> <p>Written by renowned art historian Sarah Greenough and Kert\u00e9sz Foundation curator Robert Gurbo, Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz includes excerpts from the photographer's previously unexamined journals and correspondence--documents that prompted the authors to reexamine every period of Kert\u00e9sz's life and work. They reflect on their findings in essays covering each of the major phases in Kert\u00e9sz's career.</p> <br> <br> <p>While the book includes examples of the artist's most important photographs, including <i>Chez Mondrian, The Satiric Dancer</i>, and <i>The Eiffel Tower</i>, it also focuses on the intensely autobiographical nature of his work. It elegantly demonstrates the ways in which Kert\u00e9sz injected his persona, both literally and metaphorically, into his work.</p> <br> <br> <p>Accompanying the book's essays and exquisite tritone reproductions of his photographs are an illustrated chronology that corrects many previous errors, a comprehensive bibliography, and selections of previously unpublished writings by the photographer.</p> <br> <p>EXHIBITION SCHEDULE:</p> <br> <p>http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/exhibits.htm National Gallery of Art, Washington<br> February 6-May 15, 2005</p> <br> <p>http://www.lacma.org/ Los Angeles County Museum of Art<br> June 12-September 5, 2005</p>",

A dazzling examination of a marriage, it is also a portrait of creative partnership written by one of the best writers of her generation. <p> Every story has two sides. Every relationship has two perspectives. And sometimes, it turns out, the key to a great marriage is not its truths but its secrets. At the core of this rich, expansive, layered novel, Lauren Groff presents the story of one such marriage over the course of twenty-four years. <p> At age twenty-two, Lotto and Mathilde are tall, glamorous, madly in love, and destined for greatness. A decade later, their marriage is still the envy of their friends, but with an electric thrill we understand that things are even more complicated and remarkable than they have seemed. With stunning revelations and multiple threads, and in prose that is vibrantly alive and original, Groff delivers a deeply satisfying novel about love, art, creativity, and power that is unlike anything that has come before it. Profound, surprising, propulsive, and emotionally riveting, it stirs both the mind and the heart.",

Their arrival led to the barbaric and unprecedented system of American chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years. This is sometimes referred to as the country\u2019s original sin, but it is more than that: It is the source of so much that still defines the United States.<br><br><i>The New York Times Magazine</i>\u2019s award-winning 1619 Project issue reframed our understanding of American history by placing slavery and its continuing legacy at the center of our national narrative. This book substantially expands on that work, weaving together eighteen essays that explore the legacy of slavery in present-day America with thirty-six poems and works of fiction that illuminate key moments of oppression, struggle, and resistance. The essays show how the inheritance of 1619 reaches into every part of contemporary American society, from politics, music, diet, traffic, and citizenship to capitalism, religion, and our democracy itself.<br><br>This book that speaks directly to our current moment, contextualizing the systems of race and caste within which we operate today. It reveals long-glossed-over truths around our nation\u2019s founding and construction\u2014and the way that the legacy of slavery did not end with emancipation, but continues to shape contemporary American life.<br><br>Featuring contributions from:<b> Leslie Alexander \u2022 Michelle Alexander \u2022 Carol Anderson \u2022 Joshua Bennett \u2022 Reginald Dwayne Betts \u2022 Jamelle Bouie \u2022 Anthea Butler \u2022 Matthew Desmond \u2022 Rita Dove \u2022 Camille T.

As we grow older, however, we become more conscious of what we can't do and the whole business of art can begin to seem beyond our reach.<br><br>In <i>An Introduction to Drawing</i>, artist and teacher Robin Hazlewood restores that lost confidence by his belief that most of us can draw as long as we learn to see objects as they are in reality. As adults, when we look at a subject we invest it with everything our experience tells us about it and attempt to convey that in our drawing - and that is where we encounter unnecessary complications and find ourselves with an unsatisfactory result.<br><br>This book discusses basic techniques and gives exercises to provide you with plenty of practice in coordinating hand and eye. Most importantly, it helps you to find a new way of looking and to develop a fresh vision of the world around you.</p>",

      "description": "<p>An entertaining and revealing look at the science behind the emotion of disgust.</p> Disgust originated to prevent us from eating poisonous food, but this simple safety mechanism has since evolved into a uniquely human emotion that dictates how we treat others, shapes our cultural norms, and even has implications for our mental and physical health. That\u2019s Disgusting illuminates the science behind disgust, tackling such colorful topics as cannibalism, humor, and pornography to address larger questions: Why do sources of disgust vary among people and societies? Where does disgust come from in our brain and what deeper fears does it reflect? How does disgust influence our individual personalities, our daily lives, and our values? It turns out that disgust underlies more than we realize, from political ideologies to the lure of horror movies. Drawing on surprising research in psychology and evolutionary biology, That\u2019s Disgusting shows us that disgust mirrors human nature and, as a result, is as complex and varied as we are.",

      "description": "\"\"Your work, Vera,\" Alfred's grandfather told me, <p>\"your work is to know the ways of our people.\"\"<p>In June of 1942, seven months after attacking Pearl Harbor, the Japanese navy invaded Alaska's Aleutian Islands. For nine thousand years the Aleut people had lived and thrived on these treeless, windswept lands. Within days of the first attack, the entire native population living west of Unimak Island was gathered up and evacuated to relocation centers in the dense forests of Alaska's Southeast.<p>With resilience, compassion, and humor the Aleuts responded to the sorrows of upheaval and dislocation. This is Vera's story, but it is woven from the same fabric as the stories of displaced peoples throughout history. It chronicles the struggle to survive and to keep community and heritage intact despite harsh conditions in an alien environment.<p>In a luminous novel of unrhymed verse, Newbery winner Karen Hesse brings to light this little-known episode from America's past.",

      "description": "In this fast-paced information age, how can Americans know what's really important and what's just a passing fashion? Now more than ever, we need a source that concisely sums up the knowledge that matters to Americans -- the people, places, ideas, and events that shape our cultural conversation. With more than six thousand entries, The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy is that invaluable source.<br> Wireless technology. Gene therapy. NAFTA. In addition to the thousands of terms described in the original Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, here are more than five hundred new entries to bring Americans' bank of essential knowledge up to date. The original entries have been fully revised to reflect recent changes in world history and politics, American literature, and, especially, science and technology. Cultural icons that have stood the test of time (Odysseus, Leaves of Grass, Cleopatra, the Taj Mahal, D-Day) appear alongside entries on such varied concerns as cryptography, the digital divide, the European Union, Kwanzaa, pheromones, SPAM, Type A and Type B personalities, Web browsers, and much, much more.<br> As our world becomes more global and interconnected, it grows smaller through the terms and touchstones that unite us. As E. D. Hirsch writes in the preface, \"Community is built up of shared knowledge and values -- the same shared knowledge that is taken for granted when we read a book or newspaper, and that is also taken for granted as part of the fabric that connects us to one another.\" A delicious concoction of information for anyone who wants to be in the know, The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy brilliantly confirms once again that it is \"an excellent piece of work . . . stimulating and enlightening\" (New York Times) -- the most definitive and comprehensive family sourcebook of its kind.",

A clear chronological structure allows the reader to see each movement in its historical context and to appreciate the patterns that emerge. The historical framework shows the extent to which the powers of royalty, religion, and revolution have exerted their influence in the artistic sphere.",

After tremendous acclaim for their series Coin-Op Comics, two brilliant creators present their first graphic novel: a menagerie of wild tales. Pushing the boundaries of their dazzling and unique narrative style, Animal Stories weaves together six short stories exploring the mysterious relationships between humans and other animals. A girl who keeps pigeons starts receiving messages from a new bird in her flock. A ship\u2019s crew rescues a dog, only to find far stranger things in the sea around them. A reincarnated cat with criminal intentions, a parrot who leads a revolution, and a squirrel who tempts a woman in a beautiful garden glade. Drawing inspiration from Aesop\u2019s Fables, film noir, and the Old Testament, Peter and Maria Hoey apply their singular and sophisticated visual storytelling to create a new set of modern animal tales for modern times.",

      "description": "<b>#1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author Ellen Hopkins's poignant middle grade novel in verse about coming to terms with indelible truths of family and belonging.</b><br><br>For the most part, Hannah's life is just how she wants it. She has two supportive parents, she's popular at school, and she's been killing it at gymnastics. But when her cousin Cal moves in with her family, everything changes. Cal tells half-truths and tall tales, pranks Hannah constantly, and seems to be the reason her parents are fighting more and more. Nothing is how it used to be. She knows that Cal went through a lot after his mom died and she is trying to be patient, but most days Hannah just wishes Cal never moved in.<br><br>For his part, Cal is trying his hardest to fit in, but not everyone is as appreciative of his unique sense of humor and storytelling gifts as he is. Humor and stories might be his defense mechanism, but if Cal doesn't let his walls down soon, he might push away the very people who are trying their best to love him.<br><br>Told in verse from the alternating perspectives of Hannah and Cal, this is a story of two cousins who are more alike than they realize and the family they both want to save.",

      "description": "<p><b>A mother's advice to her daughter--a guide to daily living, both practical and sublime--with full-color illustrations throughout.</b><br><br>One sleepless night while she was in her early twenties, illustrator/writer Hallie Bateman had a painful realization: her mom would die, and after she died she would be <i>gone. </i>The prospect was devastating, and also scary--how would she navigate the world without the person who gave her life? She thought about all the motherly advice she would miss--advice that could help her through the challenges to come, including the ordeal of losing a parent. <br><br>The next day, Hallie asked her mother, writer Suzy Hopkins, to record step-by-step instructions for her to follow in the event of her mom's death. The list began: &quot;Pour yourself a stiff glass of whiskey and make some fajitas&quot; and continued from there, walking Hallie through the days, months, and years of life after loss, with motherly guidance and support, addressing issues great and small--from choosing a life partner to baking a quiche. The project became a way for mother and daughter to connect with humor, openness, and gratitude. It led to this book.<br><br>Combining Suzy's wit and heartfelt advice with Hallie's quirky and colorful style, <i>What to Do When I'm Gone</i> is the illustrated instruction manual for getting through life without one's mom. It's also a poignant look at loss, love, and taking things one moment at a time. By turns whimsical, funny, touching, and above all pragmatic, it will leave readers laughing and teary-eyed. And it will spur conversations that enrich family members' understanding of one another.</p>",

Packed with graphics, photos, and facts for curious minds, this is a gripping look at pandemics through the ages.<p></p><p>The deadly outbreak of plague known as the Great Mortality, which struck Europe in the mid 1300s and raged for four centuries, wiped out more than 25 million people in the course of just two years. With its vicious onslaught, life changed for millions of people almost instantaneously.</p><p></p><p>Deadly pandemics have always been a part of life, from the Great Mortality of the Middle Ages, to the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918, to the eruption of COVID-19 in our own century. Many of these diseases might have seemed like things to read about in history books -- until the unthinkable happened, and our own lives were turned upside down by the emergence of the novel coronavirus.</p><p></p><p>As we learn more about COVID-19, we may be curious about pandemics of the past. Knowing how humans fought diseases long ago may help us face those of today. In this fast-paced, wide-ranging story filled with facts, pictures, and diagrams about diseases -- from plague to smallpox to polio to flu -- critically acclaimed Sibert Honor author Deborah Hopkinson brings voices from the past to life in this exploration of the deadliest diseases of then and now. Filled with more than 50 period photographs and illustrations, charts, facts, and pull-out boxes for eager nonfiction readers.</p>",

      "description": "<i>I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.</i><br> <br> So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives. <br> <br> In this ambitious debut novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America\u2019s greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Cheney\u2019s profound influence on Wright. <br> <br> Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan\u2019s Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world. Mamah\u2019s is an unforgettable journey marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leading inexorably ultimately lead to this novel\u2019s stunning conclusion. <br> <br> Elegantly written and remarkably rich in detail, <i>Loving Frank</i> is a fitting tribute to a courageous woman, a national icon, and their timeless love story.<br><br>BONUS: This edition includes an excerpt from Nancy Horan's <i>Under the Wide and Starry Sky</i>.<br> <br> Advance praise for <i>Loving Frank:</i><br> <br> \u201c<i>Loving Frank</i> is one of those novels that takes over your life. It\u2019s mesmerizing and fascinating\u2013filled with complex characters, deep passions, tactile descriptions of astonishing architecture, and the colorful immediacy of daily life a hundred years ago\u2013all gathered into a story that unfolds with riveting urgency.\u201d<br> \u2013Lauren Belfer, author of <i>City of Light</i><br> <br> \u201cThis graceful, assured first novel tells the remarkable story of the long-lived affair between Frank Lloyd Wright, a passionate and impossible figure, and Mamah Cheney, a married woman whom Wright beguiled and led beyond the restraint of convention. It is engrossing, provocative reading.\u201d<br> \u2014\u2014Scott Turow<br> <br> \u201cIt takes great courage to write a novel about historical people, and in particular to give voice to someone as mythic as Frank Lloyd Wright. This beautifully written novel about Mamah Cheney and Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s love affair is vivid and intelligent, unsentimental and compassionate.\u201d<br> \u2014\u2014Jane Hamilton<br> <br> \u201cI admire this novel, adore this novel, for so many reasons: The intelligence and lyricism of the prose. The attention to period detail. The epic proportions of this most fascinating love story. Mamah Cheney has been in my head and heart and soul since reading this book; I doubt she\u2019 ll ever leave.\u201d<br> \u2013Elizabeth Berg",

He's been shot at by international terrorists, chased down a mountainside on a makeshift snowboard, and has stood face-to-face with pure evil. Twice, young Alex has managed to save the world. And twice, he has almost been killed doing it. But now Alex faces something even more dangerous. The desperation of a man who has lost everything he cared for: his country and his only son. A man who just happens to have a nuclear weapon and a serious grudge against the free world. To see his beloved Russia once again be a dominant power, he will stop at nothing. Unless Alex can stop him first. Uniting forces with the CIA for the first time, teen spy Alex Rider battles terror from the sun-baked beaches of Miami all the way to the barren ice fields of northernmost Russia.",

While everyone else is out having a ghoulishly good time, she's stuck inside without so much as a scary movie to watch. Just when she figures this evening can't get much worse, a giant monster appears in her living room, proving her very, very wrong. Running for her life, Mona quickly sees that she's not alone; trick-or-treating's been canceled due to monster invasion! A barrier keeping billions of monsters at bay has broken and the horrific hordes have descended upon humanity, wreaking bloody havoc everywhere they stomp, slither, or squish.

Big Bob likes trucks and throwing balls and being loud. Little Bob likes dolls and jingling bracelets and being quiet. No matter what they do, they do not do it the same. But when they become new neighbours, they might just find a way to be friends... With humour and tenderness, James Howe and Laura Ellen Anderson beautifully depict the struggles and joys that come when friendships are forged between different kinds of people.",

      "description": "<i>An uplifting and poignant story about a former service beagle named Stella who must find the courage to overcome her fears and use her special nose to save a girl's life.</i> <p> Ever since Stella was a puppy, she was trained to use her powerful beagle nose to sniff out chemicals used in explosives and warn her human handler in order to keep people safe. <p> But during a routine security inspection, Stella is distracted and misses the scent of an explosive chemical. The sound of the blast is loud and scary. Stella survives but her handler--her best friend in the whole world--is gone. Stella blames herself, certain she's a bad dog. <p> Scared of loud noises, especially thunder and fireworks, Stella struggles with her anxiety and must be retired from being a service animal. Several families try to foster her, but sometimes Stella is so scared she howls or digs or tears things up with her teeth. She wonders if anyone will want to adopt her. <p> An expert dog trainer, Esperanza, thinks she can help. It's Stella's last chance to prove she can be a good dog. Stella has every reason to love her new family, especially the young human named Chloe who smells like chocolate chip cookies, newly cut grass, the pages of books, and something else--a strange chemical she can't quite identify. <p> Chloe has epilepsy, and a chemical inside her body surges just before she has a seizure. Stella's nose makes the connection. But how can she warn Esperanza without her thinking it's just Stella's usual anxiety? How can she convince her new family that she can be a new kind of service dog and hopefully save Chloe's life? <p> Told from Stella's point of view, readers will experience life through a dog's eyes, ears, and, especially, her nose. Like Babe the pig or Ivan the gorilla, Stella the beagle is an extraordinary story for kids who love animals. An endearing novel of courage, compassion, friendship, and love. <br>",

By turns puzzling and harrowing, \u201cThe Lottery\u201d raises troubling questions about conformity, tradition, and the ritualized violence that may haunt even the most bucolic, peaceful village.</p><p>This graphic adaptation by Jackson\u2019s grandson Miles Hyman allows readers to experience \u201cThe Lottery\u201d as never before, or to discover it anew. He has crafted an eerie vision of the hamlet where the tale unfolds and the unforgettable ritual its inhabitants set into motion. Hyman\u2019s full-color, meticulously detailed panels create a noirish atmosphere that adds a new dimension of dread to the original story.</p><p><i>Shirley Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lottery\u201d: The Authorized Graphic Adaptation</i> stands as a tribute to Jackson, and reenvisions her iconic story as a striking visual narrative.</p>",

Brooke and her family became social pariahs, broken and unable to console one another. Brooke's only solace remains the ice-skating rink, where she works but no longer lets herself dream about a future skating professionally.</p> <p>When Brooke encounters Calvin's younger brother, Heath, on the side of the road and offers him a ride, everything changes. She needs someone to talk to...and so does Heath. No one else understands what it's like. Her brother, alive but gone; his brother, dead but everywhere.</p> <p>Soon, they're meeting in secret, despite knowing that both families would be horrified if they found out. In the place of his anger and her guilt, something frighteningly tender begins to develop, drawing them ever closer together.</p> <p>But when a new secret comes out about the murder, Brooke has to choose whose pain she's willing to live with - her family's or Heath's. Because she can't heal one without hurting the other.</p>",

Set in the Deep South, <i>The Creation</i> alternates breathtaking scenes from Genesis with images of a country preacher under a tree retelling the story for children. The exquisite detail of James E. Ransome's sun-dappled paintings and the sophisticated rhythm of the free verse pay tribute to Black American oral traditions of country sermonizing and storytelling: <i>As far as the eye of God could see/ Darkness covered everything/ Blacker than a hundred midnights/ Down in a cypress swamp. . . .</i><br><br>This beautiful new edition of the classic Coretta Scott King Award winner features a fresh, modern design, a reimagined cover, and an introduction of the remarkable life of James Weldon Johnson. Beneath the dust jacket, the case features a detail of Ransome's beautiful night sky, spangled with stars.<br><br><b>A Junior Library Guild selection!</b>",

What most people don't know, however, is that the seeds of her novel had been planted long before that night. By age nineteen, she had been disowned by her family, was living in scandal with a married man, and had lost her baby daughter just days after her birth. Mary poured her grief, pain, and passion into the powerful book still revered two hundred years later, and in <i>Mary's Monster</i>, author/illustrator Lita Judge has poured her own passion into a gorgeous book that pays tribute to the life of this incredible author.<br><br><b>A 2019 NCSS-CBC Notable Social Studies Trade Book</b><br><b>A 2019 Amelia Bloomer Project Book</b><br><br>This title has Common Core connections.</p>",

When liquefied gold was touted as immortality in a glass. And when strychnine\u2014yes, that strychnine, the one used in rat poison\u2014was dosed like Viagra.<br><br> Looking back with fascination, horror, and not a little dash of dark, knowing humor, <i>Quackery</i> recounts the lively, at times unbelievable, history of medical misfires and malpractices. Ranging from the merely weird to the outright dangerous, here are dozens of outlandish, morbidly hilarious \u201ctreatments\u201d\u2014conceived by doctors and scientists, by spiritualists and snake oil salesmen (yes, they literally tried to sell snake oil)\u2014that were predicated on a range of cluelessness, trial and error, and straight-up scams. With vintage illustrations, photographs, and advertisements throughout,<i> Quackery </i>seamlessly combines macabre humor with science and storytelling to reveal an important and disturbing side of the ever-evolving field of medicine.<br><br><br> \u00a0",

From childhood to the years in Egypt to the time when he confronts his brother, who sold him into slavery, Joseph's life unfolds in simple words and glowing illustrations that are both moving and accessible. With its theme of brothers who must face jealousy and learn to forgive, the story of Joseph is one of universal appeal.",

A mysterious sickness is ravaging the land and the cure, Moonflower Elixir, is only available for the wealthy. So every night, she defies the royal edicts and sneaks out, stealing Moonflower petals and leaving the elixir for those in need. <br><br>In the palace of Kandala, Prince Corrick serves as the King's Justice, meting out vicious punishments and striking fear into the hearts of agitators and outlaws. Corrick knows he must play this role convincingly--with a shortage of elixir and threats of rebellion looming ever closer, the King's grip on power is tenuous at best, and Corrick knows his brother is the kingdom's best hope for survival. <br><br>But when an act of unspeakable cruelty brings the royal and the outlaw face to face, the natural enemies are faced with an impossible choice--and a surprising spark. Will they follow their instincts to destroy each other? Or will they save the kingdom together . . . and let that spark ignite?",

      "description": "This fascinating exploration of Leonardo da Vinci's life and work identifies what it was that made him so unique, and explains the phenomenon of the world's most celebrated artistic genius who, 500 years on, still grips and inspires us. Martin Kemp offers us exceptional insights into what it was that made this Renaissance man so special, and the 'real' meaning behind such masterpieces as the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper. Tracing Leonardo's career in all its variety, we learn of his unfulfilled dreams, relationships with powerful patrons, and the truth about his views on God, humans, and nature. The famous notebooks are the key to understanding the secret of Leonardo's success and genius, as they clearly reveal the workings of his mind and display the true innovative and investigative nature of his creative vision. Over 20,000 pages of drawings and notes detail his incredible discoveries and inventions - from the workings of the human eye to designs for flying machines and giant crossbows. Bringing the story up to the present day, Martin Kemp considers what he means to us today, investigates the 'Leonardo industry', and speculates about what he would be doing if he were alive today. This updated edition of Martin Kemp's best-seller is the first book on Leonardo to include two newly discovered works, the most important such discoveries in over a hundred years.",

Four years ago, his tattooed, wise-cracking, rule-breaking roommate cut him off without an explanation. So what if things got a little weird on the last night of hockey camp the summer they were eighteen? It was just a little drunken foolishness. Nobody died. Ryan Wesley's biggest regret is coaxing his very straight friend into a bet that pushed the boundaries of their relationship. Now, with their college teams set to face off at the national championship, he'll finally get a chance to apologize. But all it takes is one look at his longtime crush, and the ache is stronger than ever. Jamie has waited a long time for answers, but walks away with only more questions-can one night of sex ruin a friendship? If not, how about six more weeks of it? When Wesley turns up to coach alongside Jamie for one more hot summer at camp, Jamie has a few things to discover about his old friend...and a big one to learn about himself. Warning: contains sexual situations, skinny-dipping, shenanigans in an SUV and proof that coming out to your family on social media is a dicey proposition.",

      "description": "Early in 1495, Leonardo da Vinci began work in Milan on what would become one of history's most influential and beloved works of art--The Last Supper. After a dozen years at the court of Lodovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, Leonardo was at a low point personally and professionally: at 43, in an era when he had almost reached the average life expectancy, he had failed, despite a number of prestigious commissions, to complete anything that truly fulfilled his astonishing promise. His latest failure was a giant bronze horse to honor Sforza's father: his 75 tons of bronze had been expropriated to be turned into cannon to help repel a French invasion of Italy. The commission to paint The Last Supper in the refectory of a Dominican convent was a small compensation, and his odds of completing it were not promising: Not only had he never worked on a painting of such a large size--15' high x 30' wide--but he had no experience in the extremely difficult medium of fresco.<br><br>In his compelling new book, Ross King explores how--amidst war and the political and religious turmoil around him, and beset by his own insecurities and frustrations--Leonardo created the masterpiece that would forever define him. King unveils dozens of stories that are embedded in the painting. Examining who served as the models for the Apostles, he makes a unique claim: that Leonardo modeled two of them on himself. Reviewing Leonardo's religious beliefs, King paints a much more complex picture than the received wisdom that he was a heretic. The food that Leonardo, a famous vegetarian, placed on the table reveals as much as do the numerous hand gestures of those at Christ's banquet. <br><br>As King explains, many of the myths that have grown up around <i>The Last Supper</i> are wrong, but its true story is ever more interesting. Bringing to life a fascinating period in European history, Ross King presents an original portrait of one of history's greatest geniuses through the lens of his most famous work.",

An epidemic of apocalyptic proportions has swept the globe, causing the dead to rise and feed on the living. In a matter of months society has crumbled: no government, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no cable TV. In a world ruled by the dead, the survivors are forced to finally start living.<br> <br>Life in the prison starts to get interesting for Rick Grimes and the rest of our survivors. Relationships heat up, fizzle out, and change entirely almost overnight.

An epidemic of apocalyptic proportions has swept the globe, causing the dead to rise and feed on the living.

In a world ruled by the dead, the survivors are forced to finally start living.<br> <br>Trapped in a town surrounded by madmen, Rick must find a way out or die trying. Meanwhile, back at the prison, the rest of the survivors come to grips with the fact Rick may be dead, and a major turning point in the series is reached.<br> <br>Reprint Edition",

      "description": "<b>From the award-winning author of <i>Openly Straight</i>, a story about two teens falling in love over a summer that throws everything possible to keep them apart.</b><p></p><b>* \"Konigsberg demonstrates once again why he is one of the major voices in LGBTQ literature.\" -- <b><i>Booklist</i></b>, starred review</b>Max: Chill. Sports. Video games. Gay and not a big deal, not to him, not to his mom, not to his buddies. And a secret: An encounter with an older kid that makes it hard to breathe, one that he doesn't want to think about, ever.Jordan: The opposite of chill. Poetry. His \"wives\" and the Chandler Mall. Never been kissed and searching for Mr. Right, who probably won't like him anyway. And a secret: A spiraling out of control mother, and the knowledge that he's the only one who can keep the family from falling apart.Throw in a rickety, 1980s-era food truck called Coq Au Vinny. Add in prickly pears, cloud eggs, and a murky idea of what's considered locally sourced and organic. Place it all in Mesa, Arizona, in June, where the temp regularly hits 114. And top it off with a touch of undeniable chemistry between utter opposites.Over the course of one summer, two boys will have to face their biggest fears and decide what they're willing to risk -- to get the thing they want the most.",

Heavily influenced by African rhythms and traditions brought to the States by African slaves and by the spirituals, field hollers, work songs, and ballads developed over centuries of slavery and during the post-Civil War era, the Blues became among the most influential genres of music in the history of America. This volume traces the history of the Blues, from its roots into contemporary times, revealing how the influence of the Blues can be found in virtually all contemporary American popular music.",

Since he was little, his only experience has been living on a farm commune and being home-schooled by his hippie grandmother, Rain. But when Rain falls out of a tree while picking plums and has to stay in the hospital, Cap is forced to move in with a guidance counselor and her cranky teen daughter and attend the local middle school.</p><p></p><p>While Cap knows a lot about tie-dying and Zen Buddhism, no education could prepare him for the politics of public school. Right from the beginning, Cap's weirdness makes him a moving target at Claverage Middle School (dubbed C-Average by the students). He has long, ungroomed hair; wears hemp clothes; and practises tai chi on the lawn. Once Zack Powers, big man on campus, spots Cap, he can't wait to introduce him to the age-old tradition at C-Average: the biggest nerd is nominated for class president\u2014and wins.</p>",

For two years, he visited schools in neighborhoods across the country, from Illinois to Washington, D.C., and from New York to San Antonio. He spoke with teachers, principals, superintendents, and, most important, children. What he found was devastating. Not only were schools for rich and poor blatantly unequal, the gulf between the two extremes was widening\u2014and it has widened since. The urban schools he visited were overcrowded and understaffed, and lacked the basic elements of learning\u2014including books and, all too often, classrooms for the students.<br>\u00a0<br>In\u00a0<i>Savage Inequalities</i>, Kozol delivers a searing examination of the extremes of wealth and poverty and calls into question the reality of equal opportunity in our nation\u2019s schools.<br>\u00a0<br><b>Praise for\u00a0<i>Savage Inequalities</i></b><br><b><i>\u00a0</i></b><br>\u201cI was unprepared for the horror and shame I felt. . . .\u00a0<i>Savage Inequalities</i>\u00a0is a savage indictment. . . .

Kozol has written a searing expos\u00e9 of the extremes of wealth and poverty in America\u2019s school system and the blighting effect on poor children, especially those in cities.\u201d<b>\u2014Emily Mitchell,\u00a0<i>Time</i></b><br><b>\u00a0</b><br>\u201cEasily the most passionate, and certain to be the most passionately debated, book about American education in several years . . .

Here he brings readers more of the creepy, funny, and idiosyncratic fears they love illustrated in comic form--such as the fear that your pets will tell other animals all your embarrassing secrets, or that someone uses your house while you're not home--as well as two longer comic short-stories about ghosts.",

      "description": "For centuries artists have been expressing their ideas, faith, passion, and rage in three-dimensional works that reflect historical eras, tell stories, reveal mysteries, and even create scandals. Starting from ancient times and continuing through the Classical, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Romantic, and Modern periods, this collection introduces readers to the artists and works that make sculpture such an exciting medium to explore. Among the artists included in the book are Michelangelo, Bernini, Rodin, Duchamp, Giacometti, Calder, Moore, Beuys, de Saint Phalle, and Bourgeois. From the Madonna of Essen, the oldest known sculpture of the Virgin Mary, to the sinuous metal sheets that make up Richard Serra's Matter of Time, each work is presented in spreads that offer beautiful photographs, biographical profiles of the artists, historical context, and anecdotal information. Broader texts describe various eras and styles as the book moves chronologically toward the present day, providing an art history lesson for everyone.",

      "description": "<p><b>With refreshing candor, photos and interviews usher us into the lives of eleven undocumented young people bravely speaking out.</b><br><i><br>\u201cMaybe next time they hear someone railing about how terrible immigrants are, they'll think about me. I\u2019m a real person.\u201d </i><br><br>Meet nine courageous young adults who have lived in the United States with a secret for much of their lives: they are not U.S. citizens. They came from Colombia, Mexico, Ghana, Independent Samoa, and Korea. They came seeking education, fleeing violence, and escaping poverty. All have heartbreaking and hopeful stories about leaving their homelands and starting a new life in America. And all are weary of living in the shadows. <i>We Are Here to Stay</i> is a very different book than it was intended to be when originally slated for a 2017 release, illustrated with Susan Kuklin\u2019s gorgeous full-color portraits. Since the last presidential election and the repeal of DACA, it is no longer safe for these young adults to be identified in photographs or by name. Their photographs have been replaced with empty frames, and their names are represented by first initials. We are honored to publish these enlightening, honest, and brave accounts that encourage open, thoughtful conversation about the complexities of immigration \u2014 and the uncertain future of immigrants in America.</p>",

The only thing he knows for certain is that the police found him half-dead in the river. The world as he knows it feels different\u2014reality seems different. And when strange things start happening around him, Kane isn't sure where to turn.</p><p>And then three of his classmates show up, claiming to be his friends and the only people who can tell him what's truly going on. Kane doesn't know what to believe or who he can trust. But as he and the others are dragged into increasingly fantastical dream worlds drawn from imagination, it becomes clear that there is dark magic at work. Nothing in Kane's life is an accident, and only he can keep the world itself from unraveling.</p><p>Reverie is an intricate and compelling LGBT young adult book about the secret worlds we hide within ourselves and what happens when they become real. </p><p>Praise for Reverie:</p><p>\"This outstanding debut novel will light readers' imaginations on fire...Imaginative, bold, and full of queer representation, this is a must-purchase for YA collections.\"\u2014School Library Journal *STARRED REVIEW*</p><p>\"This fantasy offers readers something wonderfully new and engaging...a gem of a novel that is as affirming as it is entertaining.\"\u2014The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</p><p>\"The story's many LGBTQ characters are prominently represented and powerfully nuanced.\"\u2014Publishers Weekly</p><p>\"A darkly imagined, riveting fantasy... thrilling.\"\u2014Shelf Awareness</p><p>\"Joyously, riotously queer... The themes of creating one's own reality and fighting against the rules imposed by the world you're born into will ring powerfully true for many young readers.\"\u2014Kirkus Reviews</p>",

In response to a Palestinian suicide bombing, the Israeli military subjects the West Bank town to a virtual siege. Meanwhile, Karim, trapped at home with his teenage brother and fearful parents, longs to play football with his friends. When the curfew ends, he and his friend discover an unused patch of ground that\u2019s the perfect site for a football pitch. Nearby, an old car hidden intact under bulldozed building makes a brilliant den. But in this city there\u2019s constant danger, even for schoolboys. And when Israeli soldiers find Karim outside during the next curfew, it seems impossible that he will survive.</p><p><br>This powerful book fills a substantial gap in existing young adult literature on the Middle East. With 23,000 copies already sold in the United Kingdom and Canada, this book is sure to find a wide audience among young adult readers in the United States.</p>",

Accompanied by artwork from acclaimed illustrators Sean Qualls and Selina Alko (of The Case for Loving: The Fight for Interracial Marriage), this remarkable collaboration invites readers of all ages to join the dialogue by putting their own words to their experiences.</p>",

Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch \u2013 \u2018Scout\u2019 \u2013 returns home from New York City to visit her ageing father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise\u2019s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her.<br><br>Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past \u2013 a journey that can be guided only by one\u2019s own conscience. <br><br>Written in the mid-1950s, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humour and effortless precision \u2013 a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to a classic.</p>",

And so do the three women who love him: his own embittered mother, forced to give him up by Pharaoh's decree; the Egyptian princess who defies her father and raises Moses as her own child; and his headstrong sister Almah, who discovers a greater kinship with the Egyptian deities than with her own God of the Hebrews. Told by Moses and his sister Almah from alternating points of view, this stunning novel by Newbery Honor-author Julius Lester probes questions of identity, faith, and destiny. </p>",

It was going to be so romantic. And then her maddening mum stepped in: She suddenly announced a two-week \u201croad trip\u201d to Cornwall to visit Jess\u2019s dad, something Jess might have enjoyed, actually, were it not for the monstrously bad timing. Not only will this force Jess and Fred apart for two whole weeks, it will also leave the darling and handsome Fred in the clutches of Jess\u2019s blindingly beautiful best friend, Flora\u2014who, you might recall, expressed an interest in Fred not too long ago. As if all this weren\u2019t enough, Jess\u2019s mum seems to expect her to weep at the grave of every departed literary hero in Britain\u2019s long history. <i>It\u2019s absolute torture.</i> And little does Jess know, a huge surprise awaits her when she visits her dad at his home for the first time in years.",

They have battled gladiators and the German army, dodged soldiers on both sides of the Civil War, and barely escaped a fierce attack in their own home.</p> <p>Still they are no closer to finding their mother, who was pulled by powerful forces through a portal and lost in time.</p> <p>Their only hope is to turn the tables on Taksidian, the menacing stranger who wants them out of the house so he can use it for his own twisted purposes.</p> <p>But everything changes when a trip into the near future reveals the devastating outcome of Taksidian's schemes--a destroyed city filled with mutant creatures. It is only then that the Kings realize what they're really fighting for--the fate of humanity itself.</p>",

      "description": "When lines are drawn how do you find courage in the face of hate, and what does it truly mean to take a stand?<p></p>Stella and Farida have been best friends forever, but lately things have been tense. It all started when Stella's brother came home from his latest tour with the US Marines in Afghanistan paranoid and angry. But Stella won't talk about it, and Farida can tell she's keeping something from her.Desperate to help Rob, Stella thinks she just needs to get him out of the house. She definitely didn't expect going to the movies to end with Rob in handcuffs for assaulting one of her classmates after his anger spiraled out of control.When a video of the fight goes viral, everyone has an opinion of Stella and her \"violent vet\" brother.The entire school takes sides, the media labels Rob a terrorist sympathizer, and even Farida is dragged into the mess despite not being there. As the story continues trending, Stella will have to decide just how far she's willing to go for the truth, even if it means admitting her own failures.",

      "description": "Passion. It's the fuel for success, for dreams, for life. But too many teens focus their energy and passion on the wrong thing-the wrong person. Dateable pulls no punches in telling teens the truth about dating while also directing their passion toward a greater purpose in life. <br> Teen relationships seldom last, the authors point out, so why should teens invest so much of themselves emotionally, physically, and spiritually? The answer? They shouldn't. Instead, they can protect their hearts, live with excitement, and enjoy relationships in a way that enhances rather than detracts from those they'll have in the future. With Justin and Hayley \"telling it like it is,\" teens will learn how to be dateable and how to evaluate the dateability of their latest crush. And they'll get some much-needed perspective on sex, his/her communication, clothes, God-even \"chick flicks.\" Dateable also includes sidebars, quizzes, callouts, and more.",

As a young genius living in a time before science as we know it existed, Isaac studied the few books he could get his hands on, built handmade machines, and experimented with alchemy\u2014a process of chemical reactions that seemed, at the time, to be magical. Mary Losure\u2019s riveting narrative nonfiction account of Isaac\u2019s early life traces his development as a thinker from his childhood, in friendly prose that will capture the attention of today\u2019s budding scientists\u2014as if by magic. Back matter includes an afterword, an author\u2019s note, source notes, and a bibliography.</p>",

      "description": "Twelve years of unimaginable depravity. Ten days to obtain suspect Andrei Chikatilo's confession or he goes free. Certain to join the classic accounts of true crime, Hunting the Devil is the story of how a master detective, an expert in the psychology of serial killers, ensnares a cunning, seemingly bland, but terrifying psychopath. Fifty-three frenzied murders of women and children, involving mutilation and sexual cannibalism. Not a single witness. Not a shred of evidence. A terrified populace. An incompetent local investigation. This is the challenge facing Chief Inspector Issa Kostoev, head of Russia's Department of Crimes of Special Importance, when he is assigned to the case. Five years later, in 1990, after extraordinary efforts, his hunt comes to a taut climax when he locks eyes with his prisoner. Interrogation - the most intricate game of all - is about to begin, played by two, alone for ten days in a bare room, the stakes freedom or death. Richard Lourie has had the exclusive cooperation of Chief Inspector Kostoev in the writing of this book and unrivaled access to most of the other personalities involved in the case. His own deep knowledge of Russia and its people has informed his account, a relentlessly paced story of crime and punishment in a collapsing society. Hunting the Devil is a remarkable book: an absorbing story of the brilliant detective work that finally chained a ravenous, unspeakable evil.",

      "publisher": "Yale University Press",
      "publishedDate": "2006-01-01",
      "description": "Recounting the biblical stories through visual images was the most prestigious form of commission for a Renaissance artist. In this book, Jules Lubbock examines some of the most famous of these pictorial narratives by artists of the caliber of Giovanni Pisano, Duccio, Giotto, Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, Donatello and Masaccio. He explains how these artists portrayed the major biblical events, such as: the Sacrifice of Isaac, the Annunciation, the Feast of Herod and the Trial and Passion of Jesus, so as to be easily recognizable and, at the same time, to capture our attention and imagination for long enough to enable us to search for deeper meanings. He provides evidence showing that the Church favoured the production of images that lent themselves to being read and interpreted in this way, and he describes the works themselves to demonstrate how the pleasurable activity of deciphering these meanings can work in practice.<br>This book is richly illustrated, and many of its photographs have been specially taken to show how the paintings and relief sculptures appear in the settings, for which they were originally designed. Seen from these viewpoints, they become more readily intelligible. Likewise, the starting point and the originality of Lubbock's interpretations lies in his accepting that these works of art were primarily designed to help people to reflect upon the ethical and religious significance of the biblical stories. The early Renaissance artists developed their highly innovative techniques to further these objectives, not as ends in themselves. Thus, the book aims to appeal to students, scholars and the general public, who are interested in Renaissance art and to those with a religious interest in biblical imagery.",

She can leave behind the memory of the past winter; of her sickly Ma giving birth to a baby sister who cries endlessly; of the terrifying visions she saw as her sanity began to slip, the victim of cabin fever; and most of all, the memories of the boy she has been secretly meeting with as a distraction from her pain. The boy whose baby she now carries.<br><br>When the Verners arrive at their new home, a large cabin abandoned by its previous owners, they discover the inside covered in blood. And as the days pass, it is obvious to Amanda that something isn\u2019t right on the prairie. She\u2019s heard stories of lands being tainted by evil, of men losing their minds and killing their families, and there is something strange about the doctor and his son who live in the woods on the edge of the prairie. But with the guilt and shame of her sins weighing on her, Amanda can\u2019t be sure if the true evil lies in the land, or deep within her soul.",

His mother's aim was dead on. And Daddy's departure promptly followed.<br><br>Loretta, Sonny's older sister, spies by eavesdropping. As she tells him, \"How else am I going to survive in a family tight-lipped as tombs?\"<br><br>But the kids' spying only scratches the surface of what's really going on in this 1950s family in the deep South. While Deaton, the youngest, worries about pirates and vampires, and Uncle Marty, family protector, serves up scripture with every bite at the Circle of Life donut shop, somebody <i>is</i> watching.<br><br>Somebody unsuspected by Sonny. But at thirteen he knows something's fishy, and he intends to find out what. That's why one Friday after Uncle Marty pays him for dishwashing at the Circle of Life, he sneaks out of town, first by bike and then by bus. Selma, his mama; Mamby; Nissa; Uncle Sink; Aunt Roo; his sister and brother -- nobody from that all-too-serious but often hilarious crew has a clue where he's gone. And even Sonny can't say exactly what he's after, until those tight-lipped tombs start talking, and life in the house on Rhubarb changes for good.",

She\u2019s been struggling with severe anxiety for a long time, and as much as she wishes it was something she could just talk herself out of, it\u2019s not. She constantly imagines the worst, composes obituaries in her head, and is always ready for things to fall apart. To add to her troubles, her mom\u2014the only one who really gets what Maeve goes through\u2014is leaving for six months, so Maeve will be sent to live with her dad in Vancouver.<br> \u00a0<br> Vancouver brings a slew of new worries, but Maeve finds brief moments of calm (as well as even more worries) with Salix, a local girl who doesn\u2019t seem to worry about <i>anything.</i> Between her dad\u2019s wavering sobriety, her very pregnant stepmom insisting on a home birth, and her bumbling courtship with Salix, this summer brings more catastrophes than even Maeve could have foreseen. Will she be able to navigate through all the chaos to be there for the people she loves?<br><br><br>An ALA Rainbow Book List selection<br>A Bank Street Best Book of the Year<br><br>\"With Maeve, Mac delivers a character who's heartwarmingly real and sympathetic, and her story provides a much needed mirror for anxious queer girls everywhere.\"\u2014<i>Kirkus</i>, Starred review<br><br>\"This is a good companion book for other anxiety-riddled stories, such as <i>The\u00a0Shattering</i>\u00a0by Karen Healey, and <i>Finding Audrey</i>\u00a0by Sophie Kinsella.\"\u2014<i>Booklist<br><br></i>\"This hopeful offering will resonate with young people for their own lives, even if the journey is hard and takes time and patience...[a] compelling portrait of a teen\u2019s experiences with anxiety and challenging family dynamics.\"--<i>SLJ<br><br></i>\"Mac carefully makes clear that Maeve is plenty able to find joy other places than the perfect girl and that she\u2019s working at dealing with her own problems; the romance is therefore lovely and cozy and free from overtones of dependency. The descriptions of anxiety are true and powerful, and romance buffs will likely revel in a book celebrating deep connection.\"\u2014<i>The Bulletin<br><br></i>\"Mac\u00a0is good at showing how a dread-filled mind works...

The woods are full of rabbits with human eyes, a deer woman who stalks hungry girls, and swaths of skinless men. And the people in Shudder-to-Think? Well, they\u2019re not doing so well either. When El and Octavia wake up in a movie theater with no memory of the last few hours of their lives, the two teenage dirtbags begin a surreal and terrifying journey to discover the truth about the strange town that they call home. Like so many women in Shudder-to-Think before them, all they have is a void where the truth once was. But as time passes, El finds herself needing to know more about what has happened, while Octavia wants nothing more than to forget the forgetting. Can these two teens reconcile their differences before the horrible things lurking beneath their town emerge and swallow them whole? Collects The Low, Low Woods #1-6.",

She's tall for her age. She's wearing her winter coat. Her headphones are in. She's hurrying. <br><br>She never makes it home.<br><br>In the aftermath, while law enforcement tries to justify the response, one fact remains: a police officer has shot and killed a thirteen-year-old girl.

Over and over he comes to the aid of his favorite creation, over and over they let him down and turn their backs on him. This is the story that runs throughout the Old Testament. And this is the story-God's story -- that is told in this remarkable book. Drawing on the The Midrash Rabbah, a collection of lively explanatory texts written by rabbis two thousand years ago, Jan Mark brings to life the great episodes and characters of the Old Testament -- Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Cain's feud with Abel, Noah's ark, Joseph and his brothers, the parting of the Red Sea, Moses and the Ten Commandments.... What emerges is the portrait of a God struggling to be at one with his wayward creation; a God who thinks and speaks and suffers. Told in twelve vivid chapters and illustrated with dramatic black-and-white drawings and magnificent full-color plates by David Parkins, God's Story is a narrative of rare quality for all ages to savor.",

      "description": "<b>A woman ready to give up on love\u00a0meets her match in a man she never expected to fall for in this heartwarming and steamy new romantic comedy by <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Nicola Marsh.</b><br><br> For almost a decade, successful 37-year-old Samira Broderick has used her bustling LA practice as an excuse to avoid a trip home to Australia. She still resents her meddling Indian mother for arranging her marriage to a man who didn't stick around when the going got tough, but now with a new job Down Under, she's finally ready to reconnect with her. And while she's there, a hot international fling might be just what she needs to get out of her recent funk.\u00a0<br><br> Aussie stuntman, Rory Radcliffe, has been hiding his stutter for years by avoiding speaking roles. When a job he can't refuse comes up as a reality show host, he knows he'll need some help for the audition: a dialect coach. But he finds himself at a loss for words when he discovers it's the same sexy woman with whom he just had a mind-blowing one-night stand...\u00a0<br><br> Samira can think of many reasons why Rory is completely wrong for her: he's ten years her junior, for one, and he's not Indian--something Samira's mother would never approve of. Even if things were to get serious, there's no reason to tell her mother...is there?",

Especially if he's the best teacher you've ever had? Giving you an \"F\" on a quiz? Mispronouncing your name during roll call...<i>again</i>? How about blowing up the moon and threatening to do the same to Mother Earth\u2014unless you take him out first?! Plus a reward of a cool 100 million from the Ministry of Defense!<br> <br> Okay, now that you're committed... How are you going to pull this off? What does your pathetic class of misfits have in their arsenal to combat Teach's alien technology, bizarre powers and...<i>tentacles</i>?!<br><br> The class is divided: one half wants to carry on with the plan to assassinate Koro Sensei, while the other half wants to save him. So Koro Sensei splits them into two teams, led by Nagisa and Karma, and has them battle it out. The students of 3-E draw on everything they\u2019ve learned so far to battle for or against Koro Sensei\u2019s life! Then, to uphold their now unified goal, they need to infiltrate the International Space Station\u2026",

She's one of their main hitmen . . . and she doesn't like it one bit. Not least because her boss, Venus, killed Ava's mother. When Venus asks Ava to kill a family friend, Ava rebels. She knows very well that you can't say no to the Coterie and expect to get away with it, though, so she and her friends hit the road, trying desperately to think of a way out of the mess they find themselves in. Preferably keeping the murder to a minimum, in Lish McBride's <i>Firebug</i>.</p>",

She stretches her hands up high like a plane's wings and whizzes down a hill so fast on her bike with her hands way up. As she grows, she lives through everyday moments of joy, love, and sadness. And when she gets a little older, she joins together with her family and her community in a protest march, where they lift their hands up together in resistance and strength.",

Some bachelors, she has discovered, are less 'eligible' than they are 'bloodthirsty,' however... literally. It turns out that <b>there are a lot of vampires in late-Regency England</b>, and Lucy has an eye for spotting them and the desire to rid the world of them.<br><br> It's not long before Lucy -- soon\u00a0joined by the mysterious Sham, the blowhard Lord Byron (yes, from books), and Napoleon, Lord Byron's majestic psychic eagle -- is on <b>the adventure of a lifetim</b>e. From ballrooms to bloodshed, from bonnets to bloodlust... Lucy will fight evil, be tempted by evil, fight again, be tempted again, and fight some more.<br><br> A balm for the soul for readers who love <b>Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate</b> series, novels by <b>Eloisa James</b> and <b>Jane Austen</b>, and the action and adventure of <b>Xena, Warrior Princess</b>, Bloodlust & Bonnets is the most modern action-heavy love-story set two hundred years ago that you'll read this year.\u00a0<br><br><b>***Readers Love Bloodlust & Bonnets***</b><br><br> 'If you like to make fun of Lord Byron (which I do), engage in some literary vampire-slaying (same), poignantly reflect on how very much we all want to be special (oh, shut up), hear some witty dialogue, and see some good Regency Lesbian Flirting then you\u2019ll enjoy this. <b>My only complaint is that I cannot access a sequel RIGHT NOW</b>' -<i>Smart Bitches, Trashy Books</i><br><br> 'If you love historical satire, if you love farce, if you love slightly silly graphic novels, <b>you\u2019ll love this</b>' -<i>Nerds Like Me<br><br> '</i>The setting, the characters and the adventure they go on all create this tapestry of bloodshed and romance. If you know about your Jane Austen\u2019s and Charlotte Bronte\u2019s but enjoy a splash of comical humour and a dollop of pure fantastical adventure, then you\u2019ll eat this up. <b>It\u2019s a bleedin\u2019 hoot</b>' -<i>Nerdly<br><br> 'Bloodlust and Bonnets\u00a0</i>will delight Jane Austen fans with a sense of humour and <b>anyone who likes their gags with a touch of the supernatural</b>'\u00a0<i>-Starburst Magazine</i><br><br> \u00a0",

Sit with me on the woodpile as he tells a tale of faith, hope, or love.\"</i> <br> In this extraordinary collection, Charlotte Jefferies and her father Price, a former slave, introduce us to twelve best loved Bible tales, from Genesis to Daniel, and reveal their significance in the lives of African Americans--and indeed of all oppressed peoples. <br> When Charlotte wants to understand the cruel injustices of her time, she turns to her father. <i>Does the powerful slaveholder, Mr. Sam Riley, who seems to own all that surrounds them, also own the sun and moon?</i> she wonders. Price's answer is to tell the story of Creation. <i>How can God allow an evil like slavery to exist?</i> she asks. Price responds by telling the story of the Hebrews' Exodus -- and shows Charlotte that someday their people, too, will be free. <br> With exquisite clarity, Patricia and Fredrick McKissack and James Ransome -- a Newbery Honor winner and all Coretta Scott King Award winners -- brilliantly illuminate the parallels between the stories of the Jews and African-American history. <i>Let My People Go</i> is a triumphant celebration of both the human spirit and the enduring power of story as a source of strength. <br> Our hope is that this book will be like a lighthouse that can guide young readers through good times and bad....The ideas that these ancient stories hold are not for one people, at one time, in one place. They are for all of us, for all times, everywhere. <br> --from the Authors' Note to <i>Let My People Go</i>",

His cover blown, Grant has little choice but to take her on. Mira applies herself by day, learning the etiquette and customs that will help to earn her anonymity. By night, she dons a mask and slips into the city, fighting injustice and corruption on her own terms\u2014and impressing Grant with her extraordinary abilities and insights into a brewing rebellion. But the rebellion isn\u2019t all they\u2019re fighting\u2026<br> \u00a0<br> Neither of them can ignore the attraction burning between them\u2014an attraction so powerful, it threatens to unravel everything Mira\u2019s worked so hard for. With freedom finally within her grasp, can Mira risk it all for love?",

She must become the Glittering Court's diamond: the girl with the highest test scores, the most glamorous wardrobe, and the greatest opportunities to match with an elite suitor in the New World. Training alongside other girls in the Glittering Court, Tamsin immerses herself completely in lessons about etiquette, history, and music--everything a high-society wife would need to know. Once she's married, she'll be able to afford a better life for her family, so the sacrifice is worth it if she can be the best.<br><br>When her friendship with Mira and Adelaide, her roommates at the Glittering Court, threatens her status as the top-ranked prospect, she does the only thing she knows will keep her on track: she cuts them out of her life. But when her voyage across the sea goes off course, Tamsin must use her unrelenting grit and determination to survive the harsh winter far north of her intended destination in hopes of making it back to the Glittering Court in time to secure a proposal--and a comfortable future for her family.<br><br>Experiencing new cultures and beliefs for the first time, Tamsin realizes that her careful studies haven't prepared her for everything, and with new alliances formed with roguish tradesman Jago Robinson and good-natured minister Gideon Stewart, Tamsin's heart begins to be pulled in different directions. But she can't let her brewing attraction get in the way of her ultimate goal: protecting the secret she holds closest to her heart, the one that would unravel everything she's worked for if it's uncovered.",

But nothing is as daunting\u2014or as wonderful\u2014as the potent, forbidden attraction simmering between Adelaide and Cedric. One that, if acted on, would make them both outcasts in a wild, dangerous, uncharted world, and possibly lead them to their deaths.",

      "description": "<b>Cult graphic novelist Dylan Meconis offers a rich reimagining of history in this beautifully detailed hybrid novel loosely based on the exile of Queen Elizabeth I by her sister, Queen Mary.</b><br><br>When her sister seizes the throne, Queen Eleanor of Albion is banished to a tiny island off the coast of her kingdom, where the nuns of the convent spend their days peacefully praying, sewing, and gardening. But the island is also home to Margaret, a mysterious young orphan girl whose life is upturned when the cold, regal stranger arrives. As Margaret grows closer to Eleanor, she grapples with the revelation of the island\u2019s sinister true purpose as well as the truth of her own past. When Eleanor\u2019s life is threatened, Margaret is faced with a perilous choice between helping Eleanor and protecting herself. In a hybrid novel of fictionalized history, Dylan Meconis paints Margaret\u2019s world in soft greens, grays, and reds, transporting readers to a quiet, windswept island at the heart of a treasonous royal plot.",

And no one knows that better than Ebenezer Tweezer, who has stayed beautiful for 511 years. How, you may wonder? Ebenezer simply has to feed the beast in the attic of his mansion. In return for meals of performing monkeys, statues of Winston Churchill, and the occasional cactus, Ebenezer gets potions that keep him young and beautiful, as well as other presents.<br> <br>But the beast grows ever greedier with each meal, and one day he announces that he\u2019d like to eat a nice, juicy child next. Ebenezer has never done anything quite <i>this</i> terrible to hold onto his wonderful life. Still, he finds the absolutely snottiest, naughtiest, and most frankly unpleasant child he can and prepares to feed her to the beast.<br> <br>The child, Bethany, may just be more than Ebenezer bargained for. She\u2019s certainly a really rather rude houseguest, but Ebenezer still finds himself wishing she didn\u2019t have to be gobbled up after all. Could it be Bethany is less meal-worthy and more\u2026friend-worthy?",

He knows Hallie's just dumped him. He was a perfectly good summer boyfriend, but now she's off to college, and he's still got another year to go. Her pep talk about futures and &quot;possibilities&quot; isn't exactly comforting. Sean's pretty sure he's seen his future and its &quot;possibilities,&quot; and they all look DISPOSABLE. Like the crappy rental his family moved into when his dad left. Like all the unwanted filthy old clothes he stuffs into the rag baler at his thrift-store job. Like everything good he's ever known. The only hopeful possibilities in Sean's life are the Marine Corps, where no one expected he'd go, and Neecie Albertson, whom he never expected to care about. Carrie Mesrobian follows her critically acclaimed debut, Sex &amp; Violence, with another powerful and wrenching portrait of a teenage boy on the precipice of the new American future.",

They each had ten fingers and ten toes, but were joined back to back at the base of the spine. <i>Freaks</i>, <i>monsters</i>--that's what they were called. Mary Hilton, Kate's employer and midwife, adopted Violet and Daisy and promptly began displaying the babies as \"Brighton's United Twins.\" Exhibitions at street fairs, carnivals, and wax museums across England and Scotland followed. At 8 years old, the girls came to the United States, eventually becoming the stars of sideshow, vaudeville, and burlesque circuits in the 1920s and 1930s.\u00a0In a story loaded with questions about identity and exploitation, Sarah Miller delivers a completely compelling, empathetic portrait of\u00a0two sisters whose bonds were so sacred that nothing \u2014 not even death\u2014 would compel Violet and Daisy to break them.",

      "description": "Anne Shirley, now 16, is moving from childhood into adulthood. As she begins teaching at Avonlea school she is determined to treat the children as she wishes she had been treated, and has many theories as to how that should be accomplished. She also enters the grown-up world of Avonlea in typical Anne fashion by working to beautify the landscape, and helping to form the Avonlea Village Improvement Society. Old friends are joined by new ones, including an outspoken neighbor with a rude parrot and a young-at-heart spinster who proves to be a true kindred spirit. Anne of Avonlea, originally published in 1909, is the sequel to Anne of Green Gables, and follows Anne Shirley through her next two years. While it has received less critical acclaim than its predecessor, it has enjoyed enduring popularity and has been adapted into television, movie, and theater.",

      "description": "<b>In this memoir, a forensic psychiatrist chronicles her work with more than 80 serial killers and her thoughts on what compels them.</b><br><br>Judging by appearances, Dr. Helen Morrison has an ordinary life in the suburbs of a major city. She has a physician husband, two children, and a thriving psychiatric clinic. But her life is more than that. She is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on serial killers, and has spent as many as four hundred hours alone in rooms with depraved murderers, digging deep into killers\u2019 psyches in ways no profiler ever has before.<br><br>In <i>My Life among the Serial Killers</i>, Dr. Morrison relates how she profiled the Mad Biter, Richard Otto Macek, who chewed on his victims\u2019 body parts, stalked Dr. Morrison, then believed she was his wife. She did the last interview with Ed Gein, who was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Psycho</i>. John Wayne Gacy, the clown-obsessed killer of young men, sent her crazed Christmas cards and gave her his paintings as presents. Then there was Atlanta child killer Wayne Williams; rapist turned murderer Bobby Joe Long; Fred and Rosemary West, who killed girls and women in their Gloucester \u201cHouse of Horrors\u201d; and Brazil\u2019s deadliest killer of children, Marcelo Costa de Andrade.<br><br>Dr. Morrison has received hundreds of letters from killers, read their diaries and journals, evaluated crime scenes, testified at their trials, and studied photos of the gruesome carnage. She has interviewed the families of the victims\u2014and the spouses and parents of the killers\u2014to gain a deeper understanding of the killer\u2019s environment and the public persona they adopt. She has also studied serial killers throughout history and shows how this is not a recent phenomenon with psychological autopsies of the fifteenth-century French war hero Gilles de Rais, the sixteenth-century Hungarian Countess Bathory, H.H. Holmes of the late nineteenth-century, and Albert Fish of the Roaring Twenties.<br><br>Through it all, Dr. Morrison\u2019s goal has been to discover the reasons serial killers are compelled to murder, how they choose their victims, and what we can do to prevent their crimes in the future. Her provocative conclusions will stun you.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>My Life Among the Serial Killers</i></b><br><br><b>\u201cA scary piece of work, with even scarier implications.\u201d \u2014<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br><b>\u201cA profoundly enlightening book. Morrison provides startling insights into what factors breed serial killers, and she avoids the broad generalizations that make other books of the topic seem slick and superficial. . . . This is an absorbing, disturbing book that makes it clear just how much we have yet to learn.\u201d \u2014<i>Booklist</i></b>",

      "description": "In the fourteenth century Geoffrey Chaucer, who served three kings as a customs official and special envoy, virtually invented English poetry. He did so by wedding the language of common speech to metrical verse, creating a medium that could accommodate tales of courtly romance, bawdy <i>fabliaux</i>, astute psychological portraiture, dramatic monologues, moral allegories, and its author\u2019s astonishing learning in fields from philosophy to medicine and astrology. Chaucer\u2019s accomplishment is unequalled by any poet before Shakespeare and\u2014in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> and <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>\u2014ranks with that of the great English novelists.<br>\u00a0<br>Both <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> and <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> are presented complete in this anthology, in fresh modern translations by Theodore Morrison that convey both the gravity and gaiety of the Middle English originals. <i>The Portable Chaucer</i> also contains selections from <i>The Book of Duchess, The House of Fame, The Bird's Parliament</i>, and <i>The Legend of Good Women</i>, together with short poems. Morrison's introduction is vital for its insights into Chaucer as man and artist, and as a product of the Middle Ages whose shrewdness, humor, and compassion have a wonderfully contemporary ring.",

Not gay enough for the Dykes, her ex-clique, thanks to a recent relationship with a boy; not tiny and white enough for ballet, her first passion; not sick enough to look anorexic (partially thanks to recovery). Etta doesn\u2019t fit anywhere\u2014until she meets Bianca, the straight, white, Christian, and seriously sick girl in Etta\u2019s therapy group. Both girls are auditioning for Brentwood, a prestigious New York theater academy that is so not Nebraska. Bianca might be Etta\u2019s salvation\u2026but can Etta be saved by a girl who needs saving herself?",

And he's just added another to the list: the murder of his classmate Kevin Broadus, and his own obsessive plan to investigate the death. When presented with an essay question on his application to the University of Chicago--What are your best and worst qualities?--Addison finds himself provoked into giving his final, unapologetic say about all of the above and more, and the thrilling result is an unforgettable trip through the Washington, D.C. teenage underworld.</p>",

This killer has a name--yellow fever--but everything else about it is a mystery. Its cause is unknown and there is no cure. This powerful dramatic account by award-winning author Jim Murphy traces the devastating course of the epidemic. An American Plague offers a fascinating glimpse into the conditions in American cities at the time of our nation's birth while drawing thought-provoking parallels to modern-day epidemics.",

Club\"Murphy was truly born to draw Batman.\" -IGN\"A breakout hit.\" -SyFy WireThe impossible has happened: The Joker has become...sane.Batman: White Knight follows the man now known as Jack Napier as he embarks on a quest to heal the city he once terrorized. After reconciling with his long-suffering partner, Harley Quinn, he sets in motion a carefully plotted campaign to discredit the one person whom he views as Gotham City's true enemy: Batman.His crusade exposes a decades-long history of corruption within the Gotham City Police Department and transforms Napier into a city councilman and civic hero. But when the sins of his past return to threaten everything that he has accomplished, the distinctions between savior and destroyer begin to break down for both The Joker and Batman alike-and with them any hope for Gotham's future.Writer and artist Sean Murphy delivers an extraordinary examination of comics' greatest antagonists in Batman: White Knight, exploring justice, corruption, activism and the darkest depths of mental illness. Collecting the acclaimed eight-issue miniseries, this stunning graphic novel also marks the debut of the DC Black Label imprint, which features classic DC characters in all-new, standalone stories written and illustrated by world-class authors and artists.",

For years, the mark has followed Cassie, its rare appearances odd, but insignificant. Until the day she watches a man die. As she revisits each occurrence of the mark, Cassie realizes she can see a person's imminent death. Not how or where, only when: today.<br><br><br>Now armed with a slight understanding of the mark, Cassie begins to search for it. Even as she hides her secret, Cassie mines her philosophy class, her memories, and even her new boyfriend for answers about the faint glowing mark. But many questions remain. How does it work? Why her? And finally, the most important of all: If you know today is someone's last, should you tell them?<br><br>Look out for the second book in this series, The Vision, available now!<br>",

There, she can avoid the crushing reality of her mother\u2019s hoarding and pretend her life is simply ordinary.<br><br>But then Asher Fleet, a former teen pilot with an unexpectedly shattered future, walks into the bookstore where she works\u2026and straight into her heart. For the first time in her life, Darcy can\u2019t seem to find the right words. Fairy tales are one thing, but real love makes her want to hide behind her carefully constructed ink-and-paper wall.<br><br>Still, after spending her whole life keeping people out, something about Asher makes Darcy want to open up. But securing her own happily-ever-after will mean she\u2019ll need to stop hiding and start living her own truth\u2014even if it\u2019s messy.<br><br>\u201cA lovely tale for bookish readers that will give them all the feels.\u201d \u2014Kirkus",

Many important details of life during the Civil War, for instance, can be found in the diaries of women who carried on while their men were at war. In the Living History series, firsthand accounts such as these are combined with thoughtful narrative to offer a rich and vivid portrait of daily life in various times and places in history. A visual chronology, sidebars that feature quotes from people of the period and from historians, selected vocabulary words, source notes, a bibliography for further research, and an index provide additional tools for student researchers Book jacket.",

Theirs is a world of children; before reaching the age of twenty, they all die of a mysterious disease they call Posies\u2014a plague that has killed for generations. There is no medicine, no treatment; only the mysterious rumor of a cure.</p><p>When her brother begins showing signs of the disease, Ice Cream Star sets off on a bold journey to find this cure. Led by a stranger, a captured prisoner named Pasha who becomes her devoted protector and friend, Ice Cream Star plunges into the unknown, risking her freedom and ultimately her life. Traveling hundreds of miles across treacherous, unfamiliar territory, she will experience love, heartbreak, cruelty, terror, and betrayal, fighting with her whole heart and soul to protect the only world she has ever known.</p><p>Guardian First Book Award finalist Sandra Newman delivers an extraordinary post-apocalyptic literary epic as imaginative as <i>The Passage</i> and as linguistically ambitious as <i>Cloud Atlas</i>. Like Hushpuppy in <i>The Beasts of the Southern Wild</i> grown to adolescence in a landscape as dangerously unpredictable as that of <i>Ready Player One</i>, <i>The Country of Ice Cream Star</i> is a breathtaking work from a writer of rare and unconventional talent.</p>",

How did some of the world's great fictional detectives, like Sherlock Holmes, further the study of forensics? Packed with lively photos, classroom activities, and engaging prose, budding private eyes and scientists will be eager to find the answers to these and other questions in HP Newquist's latest, and to learn about everything from the world's first autopsy in Ancient Rome to the role that DNA plays in solving crimes along the way.",

But when her parents announce they're splitting up, her entire world begins to fall apart. The epic road trip she planned with her best friend is cancelled, and she finds herself stuck on a remote island off the coast of Georgia with her mom - an island with no WiFi, no cell service and no friends.<br><br>Until she meets the free spirited, mysterious, and beautiful Jeremiah. He infuriates and intrigues her. Their chemistry takes her by surprise, and when Claude decides he should be her first, she tells herself it's just sex. Exactly what she wanted, right? They both know that what they have can't last forever, but maybe the time they have can be enough.<br><br><b>\"Romantic and sexy.\"</b> \u2014Judy Blume, acclaimed author of <i>Forever</i>",

While they were spreading all their power of destruction, six heroes, each with extraordinary powers and brandishing sacred weapons, rose against these incarnations of evil. The evil was defeated and sealed in a secret place within the red desert on the planet Mars ...Today, enter six young heirs: Yuko of Japan, Parvati of India, Amir of Egypt, Abigail of Germany, Miguel of Mexico, and Neo of Greece suddenly pulled from their everyday lives. About to face the greatest threat that the contemporary world has ever known, in a flash, they get to discover just how worthy successors they may be of the ancient heroes.",

      "description": "<b>\"Magnificent.\" -- Holly Black, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><p></p><b>Come to the crossroads, to the crossroads come</b>Sierra Santiago planned an easy summer of making art and hanging with her friends. But then a corpse crashes the first party of the season. Her stroke-ridden grandfather starts apologizing over and over. And when the murals in her neighborhood begin to weep real tears . . . Well, something more sinister than the usual Brooklyn ruckus is going on.<b>Where the powers converge and become one</b>With the help of a fellow artist named Robbie, Sierra discovers shadowshaping, a thrilling magic that infuses ancestral spirits into paintings, music, and stories. But someone is killing the shadowshapers one by one -- and the killer believes Sierra is hiding their greatest secret. Now she must unravel her family's past, take down the killer in the present, and save the future of shadowshaping for herself and generations to come.Full of a joyful, defiant spirit and writing as luscious as a Brooklyn summer night, <i>Shadowshaper</i> introduces a fantasy heroine and magic unlike any you've ever seen before, and marks the YA debut of a brilliant new storyteller.",

Nobel winner . . . bestselling author . . . safe-cracker. <br><br>In this substantial graphic novel biography, First Second presents the larger-than-life exploits of Nobel-winning quantum physicist, adventurer, musician, world-class raconteur, and one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century: Richard Feynman. Written by nonfiction comics mainstay Jim Ottaviani and brilliantly illustrated by First Second author Leland Myrick, <i>Feynman </i>tells the story of the great man's life from his childhood in Long Island to his work on the Manhattan Project and the Challenger disaster. Ottaviani tackles the bad with the good, leaving the reader delighted by Feynman's exuberant life and staggered at the loss humanity suffered with his death. <br><br>Anyone who ever wanted to know more about Richard P. Feynman, quantum electrodynamics, the fine art of the bongo drums, the outrageously obscure nation of Tuva, or the development and popularization of the field of physics in the United States need look no further than this rich and joyful work.<br><br>One of <i>School Library Journal</i>'s Best Adult Books 4 Teens titles of 2011 <br>One of <i>Horn Book</i>'s Best Nonfiction Books of 2011</p>",

Bullied. Disliked. But I know I can still be the best.</i><br><br> Sometimes, 12-year-old Donte wishes he were invisible. As one of the few black boys at Middlefield Prep, most of the students don't look like him. They don't like him either. Dubbing him \"Black Brother,\" Donte's teachers and classmates make it clear they wish he were more like his lighter-skinned brother, Trey.<br><br> When he's bullied and framed by the captain of the fencing team, \"King\" Alan, he's suspended from school and arrested.<br><br> Terrified, searching for a place where he belongs, Donte joins a local youth center and meets former Olympic fencer Arden Jones. With Arden's help, he begins training as a competitive fencer, setting his sights on taking down the fencing team captain, no matter what.<br><br> As Donte hones his fencing skills and grows closer to achieving his goal, he learns the fight for justice is far from over. Now Donte must confront his bullies, racism, and the corrupt systems of power that led to his arrest.<br><br> Powerful and emotionally gripping, <i>Black Brother, Black Brother</i> is a careful examination of the school-to-prison pipeline and follows one boy's fight against racism and his empowering path to finding his voice.",

A life without Fang is a life unimaginable.<br><br> When a newly created winged boy, the magnificent Dylan, is introduced into the flock, their world is upended yet again. Raised in a lab like the others, Dylan exists for only one reason: <i>he was designed to be Max's perfect other half. </i>Thus unfolds a battle of perfection versus passion that terrifies, twists, and turns...and meanwhile, <i>the apocalypse is coming</i>.",

Max and the other members of the Flock-six kids who share her remarkable ability-have been asked to aid a group of environmental scientists studying the causes of global warming. The expedition seems like a perfect combination of adventure, activism-and escaping government forces who watch the Flock like a hawk.<br><br> But even in Antarctica, trapped in the harshest weather on our planet, Maximum Ride is an irresistible target in constant danger. For whoever controls her powers could also control the world . . .

Angel Hill is a loner, mostly disregarded by her peers as a goody-goody. Her father is dying, and her family\u2019s financial situation is in turmoil.<br><br><br>Though they\u2019ve attended the same schools, Isaiah never noticed Angel as anything but a dorky, Bible toting church girl. Then their English teacher offers them a job on her mobile library, a three-wheel, two-seater bike. Angel can\u2019t turn down the money and Isaiah is soon eager to be in such close quarters with Angel every afternoon.<br><br>But life changes on May 31, 1921 when a vicious white mob storms the Black community of Greenwood, leaving the town destroyed and thousands of residents displaced. Only then, Isaiah, Angel, and their peers realize who their real enemies are.</p>",

Now the Trinity Four, the teens most affected by the poison, have been isolated in a remote mansion under twenty-four-hour medical care while scientists on four continents rush to discover a cure. Meanwhile, US operatives scour the world for the bioterrorists responsible for this heinous crime, as two teen virtual spies, also infected, hunt for the criminals on the Internet. The danger remains real\u2014for ShadowStrike has every reason to pursue the Trinity Four, and their evil plan will unleash a new designer virus that\u2019s even deadlier than the first.<br> \u00a0<br> \u201cFiguring out whom to trust gets harder for everyone, including the reader, and the narrative picks up speed. Sexual tension and fragile relationships are part of the story as much as the terrorist hunt is, and the two couples\u2019 fears about their own possible impending mortality will captivate a high-school audience.\u201d \u2014<i>Booklist</i>",

      "description": "<b>Finalist for the National Book Award, <i>The Yellow Birds</i> is the harrowing story of two young soldiers trying to stay alive in Iraq.</b><br><br> \"The war tried to kill us in the spring.\" So begins this powerful account of friendship and loss. <br><br> In Al Tafar, Iraq, twenty-one-year old Private Bartle and eighteen-year-old Private Murphy cling to life as their platoon launches a bloody battle for the city. Bound together since basic training when Bartle makes a promise to bring Murphy safely home, the two have been dropped into a war neither is prepared for. <br><br> In the endless days that follow, the two young soldiers do everything to protect each other from the forces that press in on every side: the insurgents, physical fatigue, and the mental stress that comes from constant danger. As reality begins to blur into a hazy nightmare, Murphy becomes increasingly unmoored from the world around him and Bartle takes actions he could never have imagined. <br><br> With profound emotional insight, especially into the effects of a hidden war on mothers and families at home, <i>The Yellow Birds</i> is a groundbreaking novel that is destined to become a classic.",

Shameful to talk about and often misunderstood, loneliness is everywhere, from the most major of metropolises to the smallest of towns.<br><br>In <i>Seek You</i>, Kristen Radtke's wide-ranging exploration of our inner lives and public selves, Radtke digs into the ways in which we attempt to feel closer to one another, and the distance that remains. Through the lenses of gender and violence, technology and art, Radtke ushers us through a history of loneliness and longing, and shares what feels impossible to share.<br><br>Ranging from the invention of the laugh-track to the rise of Instagram, the bootstrap-pulling cowboy to the brutal experiments of Harry Harlow, Radtke investigates why we engage with each other, and what we risk when we turn away. With her distinctive, emotionally-charged drawings and deeply empathetic prose, Kristen Radtke masterfully shines a light on some of our most vulnerable and sublime moments, and asks how we might keep the spaces between us from splitting entirely.",

Perfect for fans of Sharon Draper, Meg Medina, and Jason Reynolds.</p> <p>Eleven-year-old Jenae doesn\u2019t have any friends\u2014and she\u2019s just fine with that. She\u2019s so good at being invisible in school, it\u2019s almost like she has a superpower, like her idol, Astrid Dane. At home, Jenae has plenty of company, like her no-nonsense mama; her older brother, Malcolm, who is home from college after a basketball injury; and her beloved grandpa, Gee.</p> <p>Then a new student shows up at school\u2014a boy named Aubrey with fiery red hair and a smile that won\u2019t quit. Jenae can\u2019t figure out why he keeps popping up everywhere she goes. The more she tries to push him away, the more he seems determined to be her friend. Despite herself, Jenae starts getting used to having him around.</p> <p>But when the two are paired up for a class debate about the proposed name change for their school, Jenae knows this new friendship has an expiration date. Aubrey is desperate to win and earn a coveted spot on the debate team.</p><p>There\u2019s just one problem: Jenae would do almost anything to avoid speaking up in front of an audience\u2014including risking the first real friendship she\u2019s ever had.</p>",

She's got more pressing problems: her mom can't move off the couch, her dad's in prison, her brother's been kidnapped by Child Protective Services, and now her best friend isn't speaking to her. Writing in a dictionary format, Macy explains the world in her own terms--complete with gritty characters and outrageous endeavors. With an honesty that's both hilarious and fearsome, slowly Macy reveals why she acts out, why she can't tell her incarcerated father that her mom's cheating on him, and why her best friend needs protection . . . the kind of protection that involves Macy's machete.</p>",

She's still struggling to process the recent death of her best friend, Blanca; dealing with the high expectations of her hardworking Puerto Rican mother and the absence of her remarried father; and keeping everyone at a distance. But when she meets Danny, a new guy at school--who happens to be trans--all bets are off. Verdad suddenly has to deal with her mother's disapproval of her relationship with Danny as well as her own prejudices and questions about her identity, and Danny himself, who is comfortable in his skin but keeping plenty of other secrets.<br> <br> In her luminous, raw, and open-hearted exploration of identity, grief and first love, NoNieqa Ramos has created an unforgettable character in Verdad.The Truth Is offers a complex look at a brilliant, queer, neurodifferent girl, the mother who loves but doesn't understand her, and a fabulously drawn group of street kids who can't save themselves but just might save her. A brilliantly written breathtaking book. I couldn't put it down!<br> --Michelle Ruiz-Keil, author of All of Us with Wings<br> <br> A brilliant, beautiful, moving story of ecstasy and loss and tragedy and hope, The Truth Is demands to be read. The fast-moving plot bristles with literary and classical references, but the deepest insights--and there are plenty--come from the unforgettable observations and conclusions of its main character, Verdad de la Reyna, an unforgettably brave and complicated heroine who confronts profoundly disturbing, real-world challenges with the help of friends, both present and past. Nonieqa Ramos follows up The Disturbed Girl's Dictionary with another superb novel guaranteed to break the reader's heart before trying to mend it.<br> --Tom Wilinsky and Jen Sternick, authors of Snowsisters<br> <br> NoNieqa Ramos's un-flinching voice and writing style continues to cement her as a force to be reckoned with in the YA world.<br> --Mia Garc\u00eda, author of The Resolutions</p>",

      "description": "SYNOPSIS, Shut Up!, by Marilyn Reynolds <br>When their mother gets sent to Iraq with her National Guard Unit, seventeen-year-old Mario Barajas and his ten-year-old brother, Eddie, go to live with their aunt Carmen. Mario is not pleased with the arrangement because Carmen is \"one of those people that gets all bent over every little thing, plus she likes Eddie way better than she likes me.\" But the boys want to stay in their own schools, and Carmen is their only hope for that. She becomes their legal guardian and Mario and Eddie move in with her the night before their mother, Max, has to report for duty.<br>Max tells Mario that Carmen's busy with her job at the bank, and with Denton, the new love of her life, and as long as they follow her house rules and keep a low profile, they won't have anything to worry about with Carmen.<br>Soon after the boys move in, Denton begins spending more and more time at Carmen's. Mario says Denton \"hecka bugs me. He talks like he knows everything, and he acts like he owns the place, even though it's Carmen who pays the rent.\" But he sees that Denton is nice to Eddie, and Eddie likes the attention.<br>Mario's focus on his girlfriend, his job at Java Jive, and school, and he's barely aware that Eddie is laughing less, and sometimes behaving rather strangely. The, after they've been at Carmen's several months, Mario comes home from work earlier than expected and sees \"Denton sitting on the edge of Eddie's bed, with Eddie's face pushed down onto his lap. Denton's pants are open and his briefs are pulled down, and he's holding Eddie's mouth down on his dick.\"<br>Mario goes into a rage, attacking Denton with all his might, but he's no physical match for the man. When he threatens to call the police, Denton tells him the first thing that will happen with police involvement is \"they'll want to protect you nice little boys. Which means they'll take you away and out you in foster homes. Probably a group home for you, Mister Mario. No regular family wants to take in a smart-ass seventeen-year-old loser-boy like you...Eddie boy here; they'll take him away and put him in a different foster home. You'll both change schools. One of you may be in Riverside, and the other in Northridge. Who Knows? Protective services go a long way to find foster homes. Maybe you'll get to see each other once or twice a month, if you have nice foster parents. You get my drift?\"<br>When Carmen comes in that evening, Denton acts as if nothing has happened. Mario doubts that Carmen would believe him if he said anything against Denton. When he and Eddie are alone, he tries to get Eddie to talk to him but Eddie has taken seriously Denton's threats to kill them both if they don't \"Shut up and stay shut up.\" Mario tries to keep Eddie away from Denton, but realizes he can't be with Eddie all of the time. Finally, he feels he has no choice but to run away with Eddie. They take Max's old car and go four hundred miles to an Aunt and Uncle's in Redville, a California farming community.<br>Carmen figures out where they've gone. She drives up to Redville to retrieve Eddie. She claims Mario is \"incorrigible\" and wants nothing more to do with him, but she loves Eddie and she and Denton are going to get married and provide a good home for him. Mario finally tells the family what's been going on, but Eddie, who stays \"shut up,\" doesn't back Mario up, and the others doubt his story. It is not until another family member takes a good look at Eddie's drawings that she notices details that might indicate molestation. In the meantime, Max has called from Iraq and urged the Redville family to keep the boys with them until she can help sort things out. Ultimately, Denton is arrested and the boys are in a safe, stable place, but both their lives have been drastically changed by their experiences. The story ends on an uneasily hopeful note.",

These are not exactly household words, but they are a few of the many fascinating and curious creatures featured in the What on Earth series. Each volume fully explores the lifestyles and habitats of animals that few people even know exist. Simple, concise text covers the animal's classification, its unique characteristics, its methods of survival, what the animal eats and who eats it, reproduction and care of the young, conservation issues, and the relationship of the animal to humans. Each book's large size and stunning, full-color photographs bring these remarkable subjects to life. A glossary, further reading list, map, and index make What on Earth books as educational as they are fun!",

The time is now. We are in a small room with the vampire, face to face, as he speaks--as he pours out the hypnotic, shocking, moving, and erotically charged confessions of his first two hundred years as one of the living dead. . . He speaks quietly, plainly, even gently . . . carrying us back to the night when he departed human existence as heir--young, romantic, cultivated--to a great Louisiana plantation, and was inducted by the radiant and sinister Lestat into the other, the \"endless,\" life . . . learning first to sustain himself on the blood of cocks and rats caught in the raffish streets of New Orleans, then on the blood of human beings . . . to the years when, moving away from his final human ties under the tutelage of the hated yet necessary Lestat, he gradually embraces the habits, hungers, feelings of vampirism: the detachment, the hardened will, the \"superior\" sensual pleasures. He carries us back to the crucial moment in a dark New Orleans street when he finds the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her, struggling against the last residue of human feeling within him. We see how Claudia in turn is made a vampire--all her passion and intelligence trapped forever in the body of a small child--and how they arrive at their passionate and dangerous alliance, their French Quarter life of opulence: delicate Grecian statues, Chinese vases, crystal chandeliers, a butler, a maid, a stone nymph in the hidden garden court . . . night curving into night with their vampire senses heightened to the beauty of the world, thirsting for the beauty of death--a constant stream of vulnerable strangers awaiting them below . . . We see them joined against the envious, dangerous Lestat, embarking on a perilous search across Europe for others like themselves, desperate to discover the world they belong to, the ways of survival, to know what they are and why, where they came from, what their future can be . . . We follow them across Austria and Transylvania, encountering their kind in forms beyond their wildest imagining . . . to Paris, where footsteps behind them, in exact rhythm with their own, steer them to the doors of the Theatre des Vampires--the beautiful, lewd, and febrile mime theatre whose posters of penny-dreadful vampires at once mask and reveal the horror within . . . to their meeting with the eerily magnetic Armand, who brings them, at last, into intimacy with a whole brilliant and decadent society of vampires, an intimacy that becomes sudden terror when they are compelled to confront what they have feared and fled . . . In its unceasing flow of spellbinding storytelling, of danger and flight, of loyalty and treachery, Interview with the Vampire bears witness of a literary imagination of the first order.",

They took him home, named him Christian, raised him and loved him--and in the process, Christian became a London celebrity. But when Christian got too big for their apartment, Ace and John knew that it was time to let him go back to Africa, where he belonged. When they went to visit him in Africa, they were in for a wonderful surprise. Christian remembered them! <br><br>This heartwarming book is based on the true story of two men who raised and loved a lion cub--which millions of fans know through the popular YouTube video.",

After his famously disastrous stay with Vincent van Gogh in southern France, Gauguin escaped European civilization for the Polynesian islands. Immersing himself in the culture, he produced a series of radiant canvases and powerful sculptures \u2013 his last great works. From his childhood in Peru to his experiences in Tahiti, the story of Gauguin's life is recounted in authoritative text by an expert on the Post-Impressionists and compelling imagery by an award-winning illustrator.",

What are your options when you feel like your physical sex is out of sync with who you are? Explore the answers to these questions and more with an in-depth look at what it means to be transgender. Learn from the personal experiences of people who have taken steps to transition from the sex they were assigned at birth and transgender young people who have made the difficult choice to live openly as their authentic gender while still in high school. Understand better the realities of this often-misunderstood group and how it fits into the gay community. Each title in this series contains a foreword from the founder of the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN), color photos throughout, and back matter including: an index and further reading lists for books and internet resources. Key Icons appear throughout the books in this series in an effort to encourage library readers to build knowledge, gain awareness, explore possibilities and expand their viewpoints through our content rich non-fiction books. Key Icons in this series are as follows: Words to Understand are shown at the front of each chapter with definitions. These words are set in boldfaced type in that chapter, so that readers are able to reference back to the definitions--building their vocabulary and enhancing their reading comprehension. Sidebars are highlighted graphics with content rich material within that allows readers to build knowledge and broaden their perspectives by weaving together additional information to provide realistic and holistic perspectives. Text-Dependent Questions are placed at the end of each chapter. They challenge the reader's comprehension of the chapter they have just read, while sending the reader back to the text for more careful attention to the evidence presented there. Research Projects are provided at the end of each chapter as well and provide readers with suggestions for projects that encourage deeper research and analysis. And a Series Glossary of Key Terms is included in the back matter containing terminology used throughout the series. Words found here broaden the reader's knowledge and understanding of terms used in this field.",

      "description": "Until relatively recently homosexuality was considered a mental illness or a biological disorder, or worse. Today, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have the evidence of scientific research and their authentic experiences of happy and fulfilling lives to support the pride of identity that is their right. This book traces the \"nature versus nurture\" debate over the origin of same-sex attraction and gender identity. The theories put forth over the years--that there's a gay gene, that the way a child is raised can \"turn\" her gay, or that being gay is somehow a \"choice\"--all came to be used in the service of political agendas, often harming LGBT people. Examining the major genetic, biological, and psychological theories of the origins of homosexuality, this book questions those traditional notions of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation that are at the center of LGBT people's sense of identity and their struggle for civil rights and a happy and fulfilling life. Each title in this series contains a foreword from the founder of the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN), color photos throughout, and back matter including: an index and further reading lists for books and internet resources. Key Icons appear throughout the books in this series in an effort to encourage library readers to build knowledge, gain awareness, explore possibilities and expand their viewpoints through our content rich non-fiction books. Key Icons in this series are as follows: Words to Understand are shown at the front of each chapter with definitions. These words are set in boldfaced type in that chapter, so that readers are able to reference back to the definitions--building their vocabulary and enhancing their reading comprehension. Sidebars are highlighted graphics with content rich material within that allows readers to build knowledge and broaden their perspectives by weaving together additional information to provide realistic and holistic perspectives. Text-Dependent Questions are placed at the end of each chapter. They challenge the reader's comprehension of the chapter they have just read, while sending the reader back to the text for more careful attention to the evidence presented there. Research Projects are provided at the end of each chapter as well and provide readers with suggestions for projects that encourage deeper research and analysis. And a Series Glossary of Key Terms is included in the back matter containing terminology used throughout the series. Words found here broaden the reader's knowledge and understanding of terms used in this field.",

The ruling was the culmination of work by many people who stood up to racial inequality, some risking significant danger and hardship, and of careful strategizing by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). <br><br>Award-winning author Susan Goldman Rubin tells the stories behind the ruling and the people responsible for it. Illustrated with historical photographs, this well-researched narrative account is a perfect introduction to the history of school segregation in the United States and the long struggle to end it. An epilogue looks at the far-reaching effects of this landmark decision, and shows how our country still grapples today with a public school system not yet fully desegregated. <br><br>Detailed backmatter includes a timeline, primary source texts, and summaries of all mentioned court cases.<br><br><b>An ALA Notable Children's Book</b><br><b>A Patterson Prize Honor Book</b><br><b>A Bank Street Best Children's Book of the Year</b>",

Emma Goldman was at the forefront of the radical causes of the twentieth century, from leading hunger demonstrations during the Great Depression--\"Ask for work! If they do not give you work, ask for bread! If they do not give you work or bread, take the bread!\"--to organizing a cloakmakers' strike, from lecturing on how to use birth control to fighting conscription for World War I, while her soulmate, Alexander Berkman, spent fourteen years in jail for his failed attentat against industrialist Henry Clay Frick.<br> <br> Sharon Rudahl's lovely, energetic illustrations bring Goldman's many facets and passions to new life; her work belongs with the critically acclaimed graphic nonfiction of Alison Bechdel's <i>Fun Home</i> and Marjane Satrapi's <i>Persepolis</i>. Featuring a foreword by Alice Wexler, <i>A Dangerous Woman</i> is a marvelously compelling presentation of a woman devoted to revolutionizing her age.",

A shared birthday. Six years...<br></b> <br><b>ERIC: </b>There was the day we were born. There was the minute Morgan and I decided we were best friends for life. The years where we stuck by each other\u2019s side\u2014as Morgan\u2019s mom died, as he moved across town, as I joined the football team, as my parents started fighting. But sometimes I worry that Morgan and I won\u2019t be best friends forever. That there\u2019ll be a day, a minute, a second, where it all falls apart and there\u2019s no turning back the clock.<br><br><b>MORGAN: </b>I know that every birthday should feel like a new beginning, but I\u2019m trapped in this mixed-up body, in this wrong life, in Nowheresville, Tennessee, on repeat. With a dad who cares about his football team more than me, a mom I miss more than anything, and a best friend who can never know my biggest secret. Maybe one day I\u2019ll be ready to become the person I am inside. To become her. To tell the world. To tell Eric. But when?<br><br>Six years of birthdays reveal Eric and Morgan\u2019s destiny as they come together, drift apart, fall in love, and discover who they\u2019re meant to be\u2014and if they\u2019re meant to be together. From the award-winning author of <i>If I Was Your Girl</i>, Meredith Russo, comes a heart-wrenching and universal story of identity, first love, and fate.<br><br><b>\u201cBeautifully written, <i>Birthday</i> is an altogether singular contribution to the gradually growing body of transgender literature and, indeed, to mainstream literature, as well.\u201d \u2014ALA <i>Booklist</i>, starred review<br></b></p>",

But most of all, Annah would like to forget the morning Elias left her for the Recruiters.\u00a0\u00a0<br> Annah's world stopped that day, and she's been waiting for Elias to come home ever since. Somehow, without him, her life doesn't feel much different than the dead that roam the wasted city around her. Until she meets Catcher, and everything feels alive again.<br> But Catcher has his own secrets. Dark, terrifying truths that link him to a past Annah has longed to forget, and to a future too deadly to consider. And now it's up to Annah: can she continue to live in\u00a0a world covered in the blood of the living? Or is death the only escape from the Return's destruction?",

What he found so moved and astonished him that he began to teach there regularly. In voices of indelible emotional presence, the boys write about what led them to crime and about the lives that stretch ahead of them behind bars. We see them coming to terms with their crime-ridden pasts and searching for a reason to believe in their future selves. Insightful, comic, honest and tragic, <b>True Notebooks </b>is an object lesson in the redemptive power of writing.",

When Jason tells him about his speaking invitation, Kyle jumps at the chance to drive across country with him. Yet he can't help worrying: Will their romance survive two weeks crammed together in a car? <br> Nelson Glassman is happy his best friend Kyle has found love with Jason. Now he's looking for his own true love -- and hopes he might find his soul mate during the road trip. But will being the \"third wheel\" in a trio ruin his friendships with Kyle and Jason? <br> During an eye-opening postgraduation summer road trip, each of the three very different boys also embarks on a personal journey across a landscape of love, sexuality, homophobia, and above all, friendship.",

Doesn\u2019t the Bible forbid homosexuality? As Paul struggles with Manuel\u2019s interpretation of the Bible, thoughts that Paul has long tried to bury begin to surface, and he finds himself re-examining his whole life. This is an unforgettable book on an extremely timely topic that strives to open minds on both ends of the spectrum.",

In a matter of hours, the campus is transformed from a place of learning into a hive of nightmares, as the infected students collapse and are reborn as flesh-hungry zombies! Only a handful of students escape the initial outbreak - among them Takashi Komuro and his childhood friend, Rei. He manages to protect Rei from the initial onslaught, but how long can Takashi and the other students hope to survive when the whole school - maybe the whole town - is out for their blood?!",

What ultimately propels this chronicle of sexual assault and its aftermath is Sebold\u2019s indomitable spirit, as she fights to secure her rapist\u2019s arrest and conviction and comes to terms with a relationship to the world that has forever changed. With over a million copies in print, <i>Lucky</i> has touched the lives of a generation of readers. Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims and imparts a wisdom profoundly hard-won: \u201cYou save yourself or you remain unsaved.\u201d Now reissued with a new afterword by the author, her story remains as urgent as it was when it was first published more than twenty years ago.",

      "description": "<b>Lily is haunted by memories\u2013of who she once was, and of a person, long gone, who defined her existence. She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness.</b><br><br> In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu shu (\u201cwomen\u2019s writing\u201d). Some girls were paired with laotongs, \u201cold sames,\u201d in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.<br><br> With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become \u201cold sames\u201d at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart.<br><br><i> Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</i> is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. With the period detail and deep resonance of Memoirs of a Geisha, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.",

With the support of her friends and a tentative, blossoming romance with Sunder, Mirage is on the cusp of taking hold of everything she has ever wanted.However, her place in the sun is not as sure as she expected, nor is it quite as bright as she imagined.When the Empress Severine's body was recovered from the battle, Mirage discovered she was not dead after all. Rather, Severine is in a coma, her every breath a threat to Mirage's newfound power. Worse, a distant cousin, Gavin d'Ars, appears at court with the challenge of his blood claim. As Mirage uncovers more secrets from her family's past, she proposes a series of ancient, grueling trials to determine the most deserving heir. But in Mirage's fight to defend her vision for the empire, she begins to splinter all of her alliances. Will the battle for control leave anyone untainted?",

That's ultimately what Beautiful Boy is about: truth and healing.\" -- Mary Pipher, author of Reviving Ophelia<br> <br> What had happened to my beautiful boy? To our family? What did I do wrong? Those are the wrenching questions that haunted David Sheff's journey through his son Nic's addiction to drugs and tentative steps toward recovery. Before Nic became addicted to crystal meth, he was a charming boy, joyous and funny, a varsity athlete and honor student adored by his two younger siblings. After meth, he was a trembling wraith who lied, stole, and lived on the streets. David Sheff traces the first warning signs: the denial, the three a.m. phone calls--is it Nic? the police? the hospital? His preoccupation with Nic became an addiction in itself. But as a journalist, he instinctively researched every treatment that might save his son. And he refused to give up on Nic.<br> <br> \"Filled with compelling anecdotes and important insights . . . An eye-opening memoir.\" -- Washington Post</p>",

You may have difficulty setting boundaries or building satisfying sexual relationships. Sometimes, you may even feel like your body isn\u2019t your own. You aren\u2019t alone. The scars of sexual trauma exist not only in the mind, but also in the body. And in order to heal, build resilience, and discover a sense of hope, you must address both.</p><p>Drawing on the powerful mind-body techniques of somatic therapy, <i>The Healing Sexual Trauma Workbook </i>is a step-by-step guide to overcoming the psychological effects of sexual trauma, and increasing positive body awareness and vitality. You\u2019ll find tools to help you create an internal sense of safety and become more embodied and present.

And secret, too - for in the repository's basement lies the Grimm Collection, a room of magical items straight from the Grimm Brother's fairy tales. But the magic mirrors and seven-league boots and other items are starting to disappear. And before she knows it, she and her fellow pages - handsome Marc, perfect Anjali, and brooding Aaron - are suddenly caught up in an exciting, and dangerous, magical adventure.",

Sure, he\u2019s always been a little bit different\u2014his tusk isn\u2019t as long, he\u2019s not as good of a swimmer, and he really doesn\u2019t enjoy the cuisine. Then one night, an extra strong current sweeps Kelp to the surface, where he spots a mysterious creature that looks just like him! Kelp discovers that he and the creature are actually unicorns. The revelation leaves him torn: is he a land narwhal or a sea unicorn? But perhaps, if Kelp is clever, he may find a way to have the best of both worlds.<br> <br>Told with heartwarming illustrations and spare, sweet text, Jessie Sima\u2019s debut picture book is about fitting in, standing out, and the all-encompassing love of family.",

Plenty, if you are a member of the Pillage family and your name is Beck Phillips. No matter what strangeness is going on, Beck still manages to turn things on their head. <br> When Beck's personality and behavior begin to change after he makes a fateful, life-altering decision involving what else? a dragon egg, there is no one around to stop him from fulfilling his family's destiny set out in \"The Grim Knot.\" And as life in Kingsplot moves unwittingly toward the brink of another dragon disaster, Beck finds himself living a life of deception as he hides information from the people who love and care about him the most. <br> In this final episode of the \"Pillagy\" series, with the destructive forces of his family heritage running strong and unhindered, Beck must now face the truth and rise to the challenge of stopping the madness or succumb to the draconic chaos he has helped create.\"",

But things change when Sila accompanies her father (who is a mechanic) outside their Oregon town to fix a truck. There, behind an enormous stone wall, she meets a grandfatherly man who only months before won the state lottery. Their new alliance leads to the rescue of a circus elephant named Veda, and then to a friendship with an unusual boy named Mateo, proving that comfort and hope come in the most unlikely of places. <br><br>A moving story of family separation and the importance of the connection between animals and humans, this novel has the enormous heart and uplifting humor that readers have come to expect from the beloved author of <i>Counting by 7s.</i>",

Her parting gift: the tickets for their long-planned last-hurrah-before-uni trip. Only, it's been booked under her name. Nontransferable, no exceptions. <p>Mae is still reeling from being rejected from USC's film school. When she stumbles across Hugo's ad for a replacement Margaret Campbell (her full name!), she's certain it's exactly the adventure she needs to shake off her disappointment and jump-start her next film. <p>A cross-country train trip with a complete stranger might not seem like the best idea. But to Mae and Hugo, both eager to escape their regular lives, it makes perfect sense. What starts as a convenient arrangement soon turns into something more. But when life outside the train catches up to them, can they find a way to keep their feelings for each other from getting derailed? <p><b>One of the loveliest, most touching romances of 2019 thus far that gets at the nature of something deeply buried in all of our hearts. --</b><b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b> <p><b>This warm, romantic, never overly sentimental story is told with humor and heart....A deeply satisfying read about a life-changing journey full of poignant moments. </b><b><i>--Kirkus</i></b><b>, starred review</b>",

But what happens when the apples fall somewhere else\u2014sometimes a couple of orchards away, sometimes on the other side of the world?<br> <br>In this young adult edition, Andrew Solomon profiles how families accommodate children who have a variety of differences: families of people who are deaf, who are dwarfs, who have Down syndrome, who have autism, who have schizophrenia, who have multiple severe disabilities, who are prodigies, who commit crimes, and more.<br> <br>Elegantly reported by a spectacularly original and compassionate thinker, <i>Far From the Tree</i> explores how people who love each other must struggle to accept each other\u2014a theme in every family\u2019s life.<i> The New York Times </i>calls the adult edition a \u201cwise and beautiful\u201d volume, that \u201cwill shake up your preconceptions and leave you in a better place.\u201d",
